<span>**Abstract:**</span> Your new statistical or data science tool is much more likely to be used
if you provide it in a convenient form, like an R package. But how do
people find out that your R package exists? I’ll provide a comprehensive
overview of the options, including creating excellent documentation
(with roxygen2) and vignettes (with rmarkdown), creating a package
website (with pkgdown), and promoting your work on social media.

new model for time series based on repeated application of a filter to
the original data. They can represent correlation structure to higher

## Online Learning For Bayesian Nonparametrics: Weakly Conjugate Approximation {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a new online learning method for
Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models so called <span>*weakly conjugate
approximation*</span> (WCA). We consider classes of BNP priors which are
weakly conjugate. Here, ‘weakly conjugate prior’ means that the
resulting posterior can be easily approximated by an efficient MCMC
algorithm.

Suppose the whole data set is divided into two groups, say
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{old},{{\bf x}}^{new}).$ Then, the Bayes rule
implies
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}) \propto p({{\bf x}}^{new}|\theta) p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}),$
where $\theta$ is the parameter. WCA replaces
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})$ with $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$ where the proxy
parameter $\eta$ is estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence
${\mathbb{E}}_{p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})}\left\{ \log p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)\right\}.$
It can be easily approximated when we can generate samples from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ To be more specific, suppose
$\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_M$ are samples generated from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ Then, we can estimate $\eta$ by minimizing
$\sum_{j=1}^M\left\{ \log p(\theta_j|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta_j|\eta)\right\}/M.$

To apply WCA for online learning with multiple batches, suppose the
whole data ${{\bf x}}$ are divided into multiple small batches as
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[S]}).$ A WCA algorithm
sequentially approximates
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[s]})$ by
$p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_s),$ where $\eta_s$ is the proxy parameter
minimizing the approximated KL divergence. Since $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$
is weakly conjugate, we can easily generate samples from
$p({{\bf x}}^{[s]}|\theta)p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_{s-1}),$ and hence easily
update $\eta_s.$

We compare several online learning algorithms by analyzing
simulated/real data sets in Dirichlet process mixture models and
hierarchical Dirichlet processes topic models. The proposed method shows
better accuracy in our experiments.

## Improving The Production Cycle At Stats NZ With RStudio {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Gareth Minshall and Chris Hansen<br />
Stats NZ<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Stats NZ are looking to move away from the
collection and publication of stand-alone surveys to making use of a
wide range of data sources and estimation strategies. A key component to
enabling this change is to develop the infrastructure which allows
analysts to explore, test and use a range of tools which are not
traditionally heavily used within National Statistics Offices. One of
the tools Stats NZ is looking to make heavier use of is R. This talk
will outline the development of internal RStudio and Shiny servers at
Stats NZ, and give examples demonstrating the types of innovation
RStudio has enabled at Stats NZ to improve the way we produce and
disseminate statistics.

## Sparse Common Component Analysis {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Common component analysis (CCA) was proposed
by generalizing techniques for principal component analysis (PCA) for a
common basic structure identification (Wang et al., 2011). Although CCA
can identify the common structure of multiple datasets, which cannot be
extracted by standard PCA, the common components by CCA are estimated as
linear combinations of all variables, and thus it is difficult to
interpret the identified common components. Furthermore, the CCA
procedure may be disturbed by noisy features, because CCA is based on
the fully dense loadings. To address these issues, we proposed sparse
common component analysis based on $L_{1}$-type regularized regression
modeling. The proposed CCA can be performed by iterative sparse
non-centered PCA for a square root of a gram matrix. We also propose an
algorithm to estimate sparse common loadings of multiple datasets in
line with the algorithm of CCA. We observe from the numerical studies
that the proposed CCA can incorporate sparsity into the common loading
estimation, and recover a sparse common structure efficiently in
multiple dataset analysis.

## Random Search Global Optimization Using Random Forests {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Blair Robertson, Chris Price, and Marco Reale<br />
University of Canterbury<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The purpose of a global optimization
algorithm is to efficiently find an objective function’s global minimum.
In this talk we consider bound constrained global optimization, where
the search is performed in a box, denoted $\Omega$. The global
optimization problem is deceptively simple and it is usually difficult
to find the global minimum. One of the difficulties is that there is
often no way to verify that a local minimum is indeed the global
minimum. If the objective function is convex, the local minimum is also
the global minimum. However, many optimization problems are not convex.
Of particular interest in this talk are objective functions that lack
any special properties such as continuity, smoothness, or a Lipschitz
constant.

A random search algorithm for bound constrained global optimization is
presented. This algorithm alternates between partition and sampling
phases. At each iteration, points sampled from $\Omega$ are classified
low or high based on their objective function values. These classified
points define training data that is used to partition $\Omega$ into low
and high regions using a random forest. The objective function is then
evaluated at a number of points drawn from the low region and from
$\Omega$ itself. Drawing points from the low region focuses the search
in areas where the objective function is known to be low. Sampling
$\Omega$ reduces the risk of missing the global minimum and is necessary
to establish convergence. The new points are then added to the existing
training data and the method repeats.

A preliminary simulation study showed that alternating between random
forest partition and sampling phases was an effective strategy for
solving a variety of global optimization test problems. The authors are
currently refining the method and extending the set of test problems.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span>
package[@RJ-2014-013] was first developed in 2003 to experiment with
features of the SVG format that were not available through a normal R
graphics device[@R], such as hyperlinks and animation. A number of
different R packages[@rsvgtipsdevice; @cairo; @svglite; @svgannotation]
have been developed since then to allow the generation of SVG output
from R, but <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> has remained unique in
its focus on generating structured and labelled SVG output. The reason
for that was to maximise support for customisation and reuse,
particularly unforseen reuse, of the SVG output. Unfortunately, there
were two major problems: killer examples of customisation and reuse
failed to materialise; and the production of SVG with
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was painfully slow. In brief,
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was a (sluggish) solution waiting
for a problem. This talk charts some of the developments over time that
have seen <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span>’s patient wait for
relevance ultimately rewarded and its desperate need for speed finally
satisfied.

## Probabilistic Outlier Detection And Visualization Of Smart Meter Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Rob Hyndman<br />
Monash University<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> It is always a good idea to plot your data before fitting any models,
making any predictions, or drawing any conclusions. But how do you
actually plot data on thousands of smart meters, each comprising
thousands of observations over time? We cannot simply produce time plots
of the demand recorded at each meter, due to the sheer volume of data
involved.

I will propose an approach in which each long series of demand data is
converted to a single two-dimensional point that can be plotted in a
simple scatterplot. In that way, all the meters can be seen in the
scatterplot; so outliers can be detected, clustering can be observed,
and any other interesting structure can be examined. To illustrate, I
will use data collected during a smart metering trial conducted by the
Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in Ireland.

First we estimate the demand percentiles for each half hour of the week,
giving us 336 probability distributions per household. Then, we compute
the distances between pairs of households using the sum of
Jensen–Shannon distances.

From these pairwise distances, we can compute a measure of the
“typicality” of a specific household, by seeing how many similar houses
are nearby. If there are many households with similar probability
distributions, the typicality measure will be high. But if there are few
similar households, the typicality measure will be low. This gives us a
way of finding anomalies in the data set — they are the smart meters
corresponding to the least typical households.

The pairwise distances between households can also be used to create a
plot of all households together. Each of the household distributions can
be thought of as a vector in $K$-dimensional space where
$K=7\times48\times99 = 33,264$. To easily visualize these, we need to
project them onto a two-dimensional space. I propose using Laplacian
eigenmaps which attempt to preserve the smallest distances — so the most
similar points in $K$-dimensional space are as close as possible in the
two-dimensional space.

This way of plotting the data easily allows us to see the anomalies, to
identify any clusters of observations in the data, and to examine any
other structure that might exist.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The joint models for longitudinal data and
time-to-event data have been introduced to measure the association
between longitudinal data and survival time in clinical, epidemiological
and educational studies.. The main aim of this talk is to estimate the
parameters in the joint models using a Bayesian approach for nonlinear
longitudinal data and time-to-event data using penalized splines. To
perform this analysis, the joint posterior distribution of hazard rate
at baseline, survival and longitudinal coefficient and random effects
parameters is first being introduced followed by derivation of the
conditional posterior distributions for each of parameter. Based on
these target posterior distributions, the samples of parameters are
simulated using Metropolis, Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampler
algorithms. An R program is written to implement the analysis. Finally,
the prior sensitivity analysis for the baseline hazard rate and
association parameters is performed following by simulations studies and
a case study.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This presentation is focused on how R is used
in Romanian official statistics to improve the quality of results
provided by different statistical data sources on the base of
administrative data. Some benefits for statistical analysis come when it
is possible to link administrative records from different registers
together, or when they can be linked with censuses or sample surveys.
Many of these record linkage or matching methods must be done under
statistically conditions, R program being one of the most powerful
analysis tool. In Romania, there has been increasing attention in recent
years to use R in official statistics, through specialized R courses for
statisticians and training on the job sessions. A international
conference on R (uRos) is yearly organized to provide a public forum for
researchers from academia and institutes of statistics. It is also a
continuous work to develop statistics based on Big Data, Romania being
part of the ESSnet Big Data Project.

## A Max-Type Multivariate Two-Sample Baumgartner Statistic {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A multivariate two-sample testing problem is
one of the most important topics in nonparametric statistics. Further, a
max-type Baumgartner statistic based on the modified Baumgartner
statistic (Murakami, 2006) was proposed by Murakami (2012) for testing
the equality of two continuous distribution functions. In this paper, a
max-type multivariate two-sample Baumgartner statistic is suggested
based on the Jurečková and Kalina’s ranks of distances (Jurečková and
Kalina, 2012). Simulations are used to investigate the power of the
suggested statistic for various population distributions. The results
indicate that the proposed test statistic is more suitable than various
existing statistics for testing a shift in the location, scale and
location-scale parameters.

## Dimension Reduction For Classification Of High-Dimensional Data By Stepwise SVM {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The purpose of this study is to build a
simple and intuitive wrapper method, stepwise SVM, for reducing
dimension and classification of large p small n datasets. The method
employs a suboptimum search procedure to determine the best subset of
variables for classification. The proposed method is compared with other
dimension reduction methods, such as Pearson product moment correlation
coefficient (PCCs), Recursive Feature Elimination based on Random Forest
(RF-RFE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using five gene
expression datasets. In this study, we show that stepwise SVM can
effectively select the important variables and perform well in
prediction. Moreover, the predictions of reduced datasets from stepwise
SVM are better than that of the unreduced datasets. Compared with other
methods, the performance of stepwise SVM is more stable than PCA and
RF-RFE but it is difficult to tell the difference in performance from
PCCs. In conclusion, stepwise SVM can effectively eliminate the noise in
data and improve the prediction accuracy.

## Bringing Multimix From Fortran To R {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Murray Jorgensen<br />
Auckland University of Technology<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Multimix is the name for a class of multivariate finite mixture models designed with clustering (<span>*unsupervised learning*</span>) in mind. It is also a name for a program to fit these models, written in Fortran77 by Lyn Hunt as part of her Waikato PhD thesis. 

**Why convert to R?** Although written in the 1990s Multimix is easy to convert to modern GNU Fortran (gfortran) but there are advantages to having an R version available. For users this means a simpler way of reading in the data and describing the form of the model. Also for ongoing development of improvement and modifications of the Multimix models. R's interactive environment provides a more comfortable place for experimentation. Designing the new program. Rather than attempt any sort of translation of the old code, the new R version of Multimix is designed from the beginning as an R program. In my talk I will describe some of the design decisions made and the reasons for them. A particular concern was that the R version be as fast as possible. 

**How to package up the new program?** Two versions of Multimix in R have been developed, a <span>*global*</span> version with many global variables employed, and a <span>*nested*</span> version restricting the scope of variables to the surrounding function. The pluses and minuses of each approach will be described. I am conscious that I may not always have made the best design decisions and comments from others will be welcomed.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> An empirical analysis of the mean return and conditional variance of
Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) index is performed using various error
innovations in GARCH models. Conventional GARCH model which assumed
normal error term failed to capture volatility clustering, leptokurtosis
and leverage effect as a result of zero skewness and kurtosis
respectively. We re-modify error distributions of GARCH (p,q) model
inference using some thick-tailed distributions. Method of Quasi-Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was used in parameter estimation. The robust
model that explained the NSE index is determined by loglikelihood and
model selection Criteria. Our result shows that GARCH model with
fat-tailed densities improves overall estimation for measuring
conditional variance. The GARCH model using Beta-Skewed-t distribution
is the most successful for forecasting NSE index.

## Performance Of Bayesian Credible Interval For Binomial Proportion Using Logit Transformation {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The confidence or the credible interval of
the binomial proportion $p$ is one of most widely employed statistical
analysis methods, and a variety of methods have been proposed. The
Bayesian credible interval attracts recent researches’ attentions. One
of the promising methods is the highest posterior density (HPD)
interval, which implies the shortest possible interval enclosing
$100(1-\alpha)$% of the probability density function. The HPD interval
is often used because it is narrow compared to other credible intervals.
However, the HPD interval has some drawbacks when the binomial
proportion is a small. To dissolve them, we calculate first a credible
interval by the HPD interval of the logit transformed parameter,
$\theta=\log\{p/(1-p)\}$, instead of $p$. Note that $\theta$ and $p$ are
the canonical and the mean parameters of the binomial distribution in
the exponential family, respectively. Writing the HPD interval of
$\theta$ as $(\theta_{l}, \theta_{u})$, we define the proposed credible
interval of $p$ as
$(p_{l}, p_{u})= \big( e^{\theta_{l}} / ( 1+e^{\theta_{l}} ), \,  e^{\theta_{u}}/(1+e^{\theta_{u}}) \big)$.
It is explored in depth, and numerical comparison studies are conducted
to confirm its favorable performance, especially when the observed
number is small, such as 0 or 1. Practical datasets are analyzed to
examine the potential usefulness for applications in medical fields.

## Statistical Disclosure Control With R: Traditional Methods And Synthetic Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The demand for and volume of data from
surveys, registers or other sources containing sensible information on
persons or enterprises have increased significantly over the last
several years. At the same time, privacy protection principles and
regulations have imposed restrictions on the access and use of
individual data. Proper and secure microdata dissemination calls for the
application of statistical disclosure control methods to the data before
release. Traditional approaches to (micro)data anonymization, including
data perturbation methods, disclosure risk methods, data utility and
methods for simulating synthetic data have been made available in R.
After introducing the audience to the R packages sdcMicro and simPop,
the presentation will focus on new developments and research for
generating close-to-reality synthetic data sets using specific
model-based approaches. The resulting data can work as a proxy of
real-world data and they are useful for training purposes, agent-based
and/or microsimulation experiments, remote execution as well as they can
be provided as public-use files. The strength and weakness of the
methods are highlighted and an (brief) application to the Euorpean
Statistics of Income and Living Condition Survey is given.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Let $\mathbf{X}_{g1}, \mathbf{X}_{g2}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{gn_g}$ be i.i.d. random samples of
size $n_g$ from a $p$-dimensional population $\Pi_g$
($g \in \{1, 2\}$) with
$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{X}_{gi})={\boldsymbol\mu}_g$
and ${\rm var}({\mbox{\boldmath ${X}$}}_{gi})=\Sigma_g$
($i \in \{1, \ldots ,n_g\}$). In this talk, our primary interest is to
test following hypothesis when $p > \min\{n_1-1, n_2-1 \}$:
$$\begin{aligned}
H_0 : {\boldsymbol\mu}_1 = {\boldsymbol\mu}_1,~ \Sigma_1 = \Sigma_2 \quad 
\mbox{vs.} \quad H_1 : \mbox{not}~ H_0.
\end{aligned}$$

For this problem, we discuss an $L^2$-norm-based test for simultaneous
testing of mean vectors and covariance matrices among two non-normal
populations. To construct a test procedure, we propose a test statistic
based on both unbiased estimator of differences mean vectors proposed by
Chen and Qin (2010) and covariance matrices proposed by Li and Chen
(2012). Also, we derive an asymptotic distribution of this test
statistic and investigate the asymptotic sizes and powers of the
proposed test. Finally, we study the finite sample and dimension
performance of this test via Monte Carlo simulations.

## Deep Learning High-Dimensional Covariance Matrices {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Modeling and forecasting covariance matrices
of asset returns play a crucial role in finance. The availability of
high frequency intraday data enables the modeling of the realized
covariance matrix directly. However, most models in the literature
depend on strong structural assumptions and they also suffer from the
curse of dimensionality. To solve the problem, we propose a deep
learning model which treats each realized covariance matrix as an image.
The network structure is designed with simplicity in mind, and yet
provides superior accuracy compared with several advanced statistical
methods. The model could handle both low-dimensional and
high-dimensional realized covariance matrices.

## R In Industry – Application On Pipe Renewal Planning {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> R has become an increasingly used tool in industry to practically help
councils and organisations with their asset management challenges. We
will demonstrate some of the practical tools Harmonic Analytics has
developed using R to assist in asset management.

One specific example demonstrated will be recent work for a New Zealand
council that was experiencing challenges in long term planning around
its three waters infrastructure. In particular, challenges stem from the
limited information about pipe condition. Using past work order history
as proxy for pipe failures, we present a tool that uses a pipe break
model to inform replacement strategies. The developed tool allows users
to generate and compare both data driven and engineering based scenarios
through a variety of lenses, ranging from annual replacement length to
service level outcomes. A number of visualisations are available to
support comparisons. Data driven scenarios are driven from a variety of
perspectives, such as traditional age based replacement, probability of
failure and minimising the expected number of pipe breaks across the
network.

This kind of work is an exciting step forward, as councils show interest
in collaboration and pooling data to improve accuracy.

## Empirical Comparison Of Some Algorithms For Automatic Univariate ARMA Modeling Using RcmdrPlugin.SPSS {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Dedi Rosadi<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In some application of time series modeling,
it is necessary to obtain forecast of various types of data
automatically and possibly, in real-time. For instances, to forecast
large number of univariate series every day, or to do a real-time
processing of the satellite data. Various automatic algorithms for
modeling ARMA models are available in the literature, where here we will
discuss three methods in particular. One of the method is based on a
combination between the best exponential smoothing model to obtain the
forecast, together with state-space approach of the underlying model to
obtain the prediction interval (see Hyndman, 2007). The second method,
which is more advanced method, is based on X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the
seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau (see Sax , 2015).
From our previous study in Rosadi (2016), we found that these methods
are perform relatively well for SARIMA data. Unfortunately, these
approaches do not working well for many of ARMA data. Therefore in paper
we extend the study by considering an automatic modeling method based on
genetic algorithm approach (see Abo-Hammour, et.al., 2012). These
approaches are implemented in our R-GUI package RcmdrPlugin.Econometrics
which now already integrated in our new and more comprehensive R-GUI
package, namely RcmdrPlugin.SPSS. We provide application of the methods
and the tool. From some empirical studies, we found that for ARMA data,
the method based on genetic algorithm performs better than the other
approaches.

## Imputation Of The 2016 Economic Census For Business Activity In Japan {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span>
R has been used in the field of official statistics in Japan for over
ten years. This presentation takes up the case of the 2016 Economic
Census for Business Activity. The Census aims to identify the structure
of establishments and enterprises in all industries on a national and
regional level, and to obtain basic information to conduct various
statistical surveys by investigating the economic activity of these
establishments and enterprises. The major corporate accounting items,
such as sales, expenses and salaries, surveyed by the census require
imputation to avoid bias. Although ratio imputation is a leading
candidate, it is well known that the ratio estimator is very sensitive
to outliers; therefore, we need to take appropriate measures for this
problem.

Ratio imputation is a special case of regression imputation; however,
the conventional ratio estimator has a heteroscedastic error term, which
is the obstacle of robustification by means of M-estimation. New robust
ratio estimators are developed by segregating the homoscedastic error
term with no relation to the auxiliary variable from the original error.
The computation of the estimators are made by modifying iterative
reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, since it is easy to calculate
and fast to converge. The proposed robustified ratio estimator broadens
the conventional definition of the ratio estimator with regards to the
variance of the error term in addition to effectively alleviating the
influence of outliers. The application of the robust estimator is
expected to contribute to the accuracy of the Census results.

An random number simulation to confirm the characteristics of these
estimators, deciding imputation domains by CART (classification and
regression tree), model selection and preparing necessary rates by
domain for the census data processing are conducted within the R
programming environment.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient under
the normality assumption and High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS)
settings. In general, canonical correlation matrix is associated with
canonical correlation analysis which is useful in studying the
relationship between two sets of variables. However, in HDLSS settings,
the within-class sample covariance matrix $\hat{\Sigma}$ is singular,
because the rank of $\hat{\Sigma}$ is much less than the number of
dimension. To avoid the singularity of $\hat{\Sigma}$ in HDLSS settings,
we utilize the naive canonical correlation matrix with replacing sample
covariance matrix by its diagonal part only. We derive the asymptotic
normality of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient, and
compare the results of our numerical studies to the theoretical
asymptotic results.

## Applying Active Learning Procedure To Drug Consumption Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We apply the method of active learning to
build a binary classification model for drug consumption data. Due to
the nature of active learning, subject selection is an major issue is
its learning process. There are many kinds of subject selection schemes
proposed in the literature. The subject recruiting procedure may also
depend on its learning target criterion such as accuracy, area under ROC
curve and so on. Moreover, in practical active learning scenarios, the
label information of samples can only be revealed as they are recruited
into training data set, and we will pay the domain experts to label
these selected sample. Therefore, to consider the labelling cost,
how/when to stop an active learning procedure is always an important and
challenging problem in active learning. In this talk, we propose an
active learning procedure targeting at area under an ROC curve, and
based on the idea of robustness, we then used a modified influential
index to locate the most informative samples, sequentially, such that
the learning procedure can achieve the target efficiently. We then apply
our procedure to drug consumption data sets.

## R Package For New Two-Stage Methods In Forecasting Time Series With Multiple Seasonality {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Anupama Lakshmanan and Shubhabrata Das<br />
Indian Institute of Management Bangalore<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Complex multiple seasonality is an important emerging challenge in time
series forecasting. We propose a framework that segregates the task into
two stages. In the first stage, the time series is aggregated at the low
frequency level (such as daily or weekly) and suitable methods such as
regression, ARIMA or TBATS, are used to fit this lower frequency data.
In the second stage, additive or multiplicative seasonality at the
higher frequency levels may be estimated using classical, or
function-based methods. Finally, the estimates from the two stages are
combined.

In this work, we build a package for implementing the above two-stage
framework for modeling time series with multiple levels of seasonality
within R. This would make it convenient to execute and possibly lead to
more practitioners and academicians adopting it. The package would allow
the user to decide the specific methods to be used in the two stages and
also the separation between high and low frequency. Errors are
calculated for both model and validation period, which may be selected
by the user and model selection choices based on different criterion
will be facilitated. Forecast combination may also be integrated with
the developed routine. The schematics will be presented along with
demonstration of the package in several real data sets.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We introduce some important functions on a
secure computation system and empirically evaluate them using the
statistical computing software R. The secure computation is a
cryptographic technology that enables us to operate data while keeping
the data encrypted. Due to the remarkable aspect, we can construct a
secure on-line analytical system to protect against unauthorized access,
computer virus and internal fraud. Moreover, the function of secure
computation has a benefit for privacy.

So far, we developed a secure computation system that runs R as a
front-end application. In this research, we focus on the analysis of
official microdata using our secure computation system. By employing the
R script language to secure computation, we can potentially make new
functions for the analysis of official microdata on our secure
computation system. We show some examples of functions on the system
using the R script language. A demonstration experiment to verify the
practicality and scalability of the system in the field of official
statistics is also in our scope.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Flexi is a statistical program designed to fit variance
based models. In this talk I will explore the advantages and
disadvantages of the variance based model compared to the more commonly
adopted mean based approach. Several examples will be given where the
properties of variance based models provide a clearer understanding of
the data. To illustrate the differences in the approach to the data I
will compare Television and Progressive Graphics File methods of
transferring a picture. The Television builds up the global picture from
individual pixels describing a local area of the picture, whereas the
Progressive Graphics File proceeds from the global value of the median
colour of the whole picture to the local value of each individual pixel
by successive refinements. This gives a coarse blocky picture at the
start which refines into a detailed picture at the end. Mean based
models are like television pictures whereas variance based models are
like Progressive Graphics File pictures. The advantages and
disadvantages of the two methods will be discussed.

## Space And Circular Time Log Gaussian Cox Processes With Application To Crime Event Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We view the locations and times of a collection of crime events as a space-time point pattern modeled as either a nonhomogeneous Poisson process or a more general log Gaussian Cox process. We need to specify a space-time intensity. Viewing time as circular, necessitates a valid separable and nonseparable covariance functions over a bounded spatial region crossed with circular time. Additionally, crimes are classified by crime type and each crime event is marked by day of the year which we convert to day of the week.

We present marked point pattern models to accommodate such data. Our specifications
take the form of hierarchical models which we fit within a Bayesian framework. We consider
model comparison between the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox
process as well as separable vs. nonseparable covariance specifications. Our motivating
dataset is a collection of crime events for the city of San Francisco during the year 2012.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Suppose that there are multiple heterogeneous
subgroups in a dataset. In the “Big data” era, this would be a natural
assumption for many fields of application such as medicine, biology,
marketing, psychology, etc. Then, conventional linear regression models
result in not only poor prediction performance but also misleading
interpretation of analyses. In this study, we propose an extension of
cluster-wise regression models
$\phi^{-1}\left(\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{\beta}_k^\top\vec{x})\right)$,
where $\phi$ is a strictly increasing function,
$\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $\vec{\beta}_k$ is a regression coefficient
for $k$th cluster and $p_k(\vec{x})$ is a non-negative function
satisfying $\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})=1$ for any $\vec{x}$. We show that
the proposed model has flexibility in clustering and “averaging”
multiple regressors and hence includes the existing methods such as
Späth (1981), DeSarbo et al. (1989) as special cases.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Gene-environment interactions (GEI) are known
to be one possible avenue for addressing the missing heritability
problem in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although many
statistical methods have been proposed for identifying and analyzing
GEI, most of these consider interactions between a single genetic
variants such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by the
environment. In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for
gene-based GEI analysis, Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of
Gene-Environment Interaction (HisCoM-GEI). HisCoM-GEI is based on
generalized structured component analysis, and can consider hierarchical
structural relationships among SNPs in a gene. HisCoM-GEI can
effectively aggregate all possible pairwise SNP-Environment interactions
into a latent variable by imposing a ridge penalty, from which it then
performs GEI analysis. Furthermore, HisCoM-GEI can evaluate both
gene-level and SNP-level analyses. We applied the HisCoM-GEI to the
cohort data of the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) consortium to
identify GEIs between genes and alcohol intake on the blood pressure
traits.

posterior estimations are carried out via Markov chain Monte Carlo

## Cross Covariance Estimation For Integration Of Multi-Omics Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In integrative analysis of multiple types of
-omics data, it is often of interest to infer associations between two
different types of molecules. The prevailing analysis methods depend on
ensemble of brute-force pairwise univariate association tests between
the two types, best exemplified by expression quantitative loci (eQTL)
mapping. In a nutshell, this problem can be generally framed as a sparse
cross-covariance matrix. In this work, we propose a two-stage estimator
of cross covariance matrix ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ between $p$-vector
${\mathbf{X}}$ and $q$-vector ${\mathbf{Y}}$, assuming that the two
variables have regulatory relationships and that we know a group
structure in the variables in ${\mathbf{X}}$. We first decompose the
covariance matrix of ${\mathbf{X}}$, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}$, into
systematic covariance consistent with the functional group information
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)}$ and the residual covariance not explained
by the group information ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}$. Following this
decomposition, we estimate the cross covariance matrix by multi-response
group lasso, yielding
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}= {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}{\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)} = ({\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)} + {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}) {\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)}$.
As a result of this decomposition, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ can also be
expressed as the sum of a systematic term and a residual term, breaking
down the cross-covariance into a fraction attributable to pathway-level
regulation and the rest. We applied the method to epigenetic regulation

Atlas invasive breast cancer cohort.

## Relationships Between Linguistic Characteristics And The Use Of Māori Loanwords In New Zealand English. {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We present the initial results from a project
looking at the linguistic and socio-linguistic characteristics that
affect the prevalence of Māori loanwords in the use of New Zealand
English, and describe the paths we see this research taking in the next
few years.

Loanwords are words that originate in one language (the donor language)
and enter into, and are productively used within another language (the
host language). For our initial research, we were particularly
interested in the use of Māori loanwords in spoken New Zealand English,
as found within the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English.

We used generalised linear mixed effects models to determine if there
were significant relationships between the linguistic characteristics of
the loanwords used / words replaced, demographic features of the
speakers, and the ethnicity of the audiences.

We found that linguistic characteristics of the loanwords and their
English counterparts affect the probability of using the loanword for
both Pākehā and Māori speakers, there was a difference in the
probability of using a loanword between the sexes for Māori speakers
only, and Māori speakers moderated the use of loanwords in conversations
depending on the ethnicity of their audience.

We will briefly describe the next phase of the research that will use
network modelling to characterise the use of Māori loanwords in written
media.

## An Overview Of The Correspondence Analysis Family {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Eric Beh<br />
University of Newcastle<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Correspondence analysis (CA) is well known to be a member of the family
of multivariate analysis techniques and is concerned with the
visualisation of the association between two or more categorical
variables. The classic texts of Greenacre (1984) and Lebart, Morineau
and Warwick (1984), for example, provide an excellent technical,
practical and historical account of development of CA up to that period.
What is less well known is that the literature on CA extends well beyond
the traditional approaches that can be found in many multivariate texts
and often there are disciplines that redefine the way in which it is
performed. For example, the various fields of ecology have successfully
germinated variants including <span>*canonical correspondence
analysis*</span> and <span>*detrended correspondence analysis*</span>.
However the scope, and literature, of CA is not confined to these
examples. Beh and Lombardo (2014, Section 1.6.3) and provide a
comprehensive list of members of the “family” which, now, number about
50 members. I shall provide an overview of some of the popular, and
not-so-popular, members of the CA family.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We present a new statistical test of
association between a trait and genetic markers, which we theoretically
and practically prove to be robust to arbitrarily complex population
structure. The statistical test involves a set of parameters that can be
directly estimated from large-scale genotyping data, such as those
measured in genome-wide associations studies. We also derive a new set
of methodologies, called a genotype-conditional association test, shown
to provide accurate association tests in populations with complex

to the trait. We demonstrate the proposed method on a large simulation
study and on the real data. Our proposed framework provides a

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The raw meteorological data need to be cleaned since they
are from the diverse sources such as ASOS(Automated Synoptic Observing
System) and AWS(Automatic Weather Station). The meteorological data in
South Korea is observed from about 100 ASOS and 500 AWS. In order to
produce the high qualified meteorological data, several data quality
control algorithms are applied. In this study, cluster analysis for
almost 600 meteorological sites is applied depending on their climatic
characteristics. After clustering, we propose the several threshold
algorithms in the given cluster. The proposed threshold values for data
quality control algorithms will be adequate to Korea climate condition
by cluster and month. Thresholds of QC algorithms, which are step test,
persistence test and climate range test, are determined. Through these
algorithms and threshold, the qualified meteorological data can be
produced for the improved forecast accuracy.

## Regularized Noise-Reduction Methodology For High-Dimensional Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk, we consider principal component
analysis (PCA) methods in high-dimensional settings. We first consider
asymptotic properties of the conventional estimator of eigenvalues. We
show that the estimator is affected by the high-dimensional noise
structure directly, so that it becomes inconsistent. In order to
overcome such difficulties in a high-dimensional situation, Yata and
Aoshima (2012) developed a new PCA method called the noise-reduction
(NR) methodology. We show that the NR method can enjoy consistency
properties not only for eigenvalues but also for PC directions in
high-dimensional settings. The estimator of the PC directions by the NR
method has a consistency property in terms of an inner product. However,
it does not hold a consistency property in terms of the Euclid norm.
With the help of a thresholding method, we modify the estimator and
propose a regularized NR method. We show that it holds the consistency
property of the Euclid norm. Finally, we check the performance of the
new NR method by using microarray data sets.

## Computation Of Influence Functions For Robust Statistics {.unnumbered}

Maheswaran Rohan<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Robust statistics are often computed when outliers are present. One of
the diagnostics tools for assessing the robustness of estimation is the
influence function, which measures the impact on a statistic of adding
new data to or removing existing data from the data set. It is also
useful for computing the standard error of the statistic.

The computation of influence function for closed form estimates is
relatively easy in comparison to that for non-closed form estimates.
However, robust statistics are often not in closed form and are computed
using iterative algorithms. Obtaining the analytical form of the
empirical influence functions of robust statistics for multiple
parameters is rare in the current literature and not easy.

In this talk, I use matrix algebra including matrix derivation to show
how influence functions for robust statistics can be obtained
analytically, particularly in M-estimators with multiple of parameter
vectors.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper aims to propose a data-adaptive
model averaging estimation in the high-dimensional framework. To this
end, We first consider the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA) proposed by
Ing and Lai (2011) to construct a set of nested models. The
high-dimensional model averaging criteria (HDMMA) suggested by Ing
(2016) is considered upon the OGA nested models, while the penalty term
is unknown and needed to be estimated. We then use the cross-validation
to select the optimal penalty. This method of penalty selection is shown
to be optimally adaptive to a wide class of data generating processes.
Furthermore, the resultant HDMMA estimator based on the selected penalty
is shown to be asymptotic rate efficient. Finally, numerical studies in
this paper are expected to shed some light on the choice of data
splitting ratio for the cross-validation.

## Model-Based Clustering For Multivariate Categorical Data With Dimension Reduction {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Michio Yamamoto<br />
Okayama University<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A novel model-based clustering procedure for
multivariate categorical data is proposed. The proposed model assumes
that each response probability has a low-dimensional representation of
the cluster structure, which is constructed by weights for categorical
variables and scores for cluster representatives. For the visualization
of the cluster structure, we define low-dimensional scores for
individuals as convex combinations of scores for cluster
representatives, which may be interpretable in a similar manner to the
archetypal analysis developed by Cutler and Breiman (1994). Because the
proposed model has the so-called rotational indeterminacy, it is needed
to conduct rotation methods after parameter estimation to obtain
interpretable results. Instead of this two-step approach, we develop a
penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a sparsity-inducing penalty
on the weights for categorical variables. To optimize the proposed
penalized likelihood criterion, we develop an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm with gradient projection and coordinate descent. It is
shown that there is trade-off relation between the convergence rate of
the algorithm and the cluster recovery.

## Phylogenetic Tree-Based Microbiome Association Test {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Microbial metagenomics data has large
inter-subject variation and operational taxonomic units (OTU) for each
species are usually very sparse. Because of these problems,
non-parametric approaches such as Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon
rank-sum test have been utilized. However these approaches suffer from
low statistical powers for association analyses and thus investigation
on efficient statistical analyses is necessary. Main goal in my thesis
is to propose phylogenetic Tree-based Microbiome Association Test (TMAT)
for association analyses between microbiome abundances of each OTU and
disease phenotype. Phylogenetic tree reveals similarity between
different OTUs, and thus was used to provide TMAT. TMAT calculates score
test statistics for each node and test statistics for all nodes are
combined into a single statistics by minimum p-value or Fisher’s combing
p-value method. TMAT was compared with existing methods with extensive
simulations. Simulation studies show that TMAT preserves the nominal
type-1 error and its statistical powers were usually much better than
existing methods for considered scenarios. Furthermore it was applied to
atopic diseases and found that community profiles of Enterococcus is
associated.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A case-cohort design is an efficient study
design for analyzing failure time data by reducing the cost and effort
of conducting a large cohort study. Estimation of regression
coefficients is typically done through a weighted estimating equation
approach whose weight is the inverse of the sampling probabilities.
Several techniques to enhance the efficiency by estimating weights or
calibrating weights based on auxiliary variables have been developed for
Cox models. In this paper, we propose to extend these methodologies to
semiparametric additive hazards models. The proposed estimators are
demonstrated to be more efficient, via simulation studies, than the
usual Horvitz-Thompson type estimator. We illustrate a use of the
proposed estimators by using the National Wilms Tumor Study data.

## Selecting The Number Of Principal Components {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of
the most popular methods in multivariate data analysis, which can be
applied to covariance matrices. Despite the popularity of the method,
there is no widely adopted standard approach to select the number of
principal components to retain. To address this issue, we propose a
novel method utilizing the hypothesis testing framework and test whether
the currently selected principal components capture all the
statistically significant signals in the given data set. While existing
hypothesis testing approaches do not enjoy the exact type 1 error
property and lose power under some scenarios, the proposed method
provides an exact type 1 error control along with decent size of power
in detecting signals. Central to our work is the post-selection
inference framework which facilitates valid inference after data-driven
model selection; the proposed hypothesis testing method provides exact
type 1 error controls by conditioning on the selection event which leads
to the inference. We also introduce a possible extension of the proposed
method for high-dimensional data.

## Rolling Survival Extrapolation Algorithm For Estimating Life Years Lost Among Subjects Exposed To Long-Term Air Pollution {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Measure of expected years of life lost (EYLL) of a cohort of subjects
living with specific conditions would be useful for quantifying and
thereby comparing the societal burden of different conditions. One
promising approach of estimating EYLL is based on relative survival
between the index cohort and an age- and sex-matched reference
population generated from vital statistics to extrapolate survival
function of the index cohort. The EYLL is then estimated by computing
the area between the survival curve of the reference population and
extrapolated survival curve of the index cohort. In this talk, we will
introduce our newly developed method called rolling survival
extrapolation algorithm which consists of two major stages. First, we
apply logit transformation to the relative survival so that the
transformed curve beyond follow-up would approximate to a nearly
straight line. Second, similar to the rolling forecast process for
predicting the future over a set period of time, we take advantage of
the accurate short-term extrapolation of restricted cubic splines models
to guide the transformed relative survival forward step-by-step using
the model updated data. There are some studies that provide general
evidence for long-term associations of air pollution with hospital
admissions and death of various causes. We have found no published
epidemiological studies on the effects of long-term air pollution
exposure and life years lost. With the proposed method, we estimate EYLL
from long-term exposure to air pollution among Taiwanese adult
population at rural township and city district levels. The results show
that elderly people living in a worse local air pollution for decades
long had more expected years of life lost after adjusting social
economic status.

In this presentation, to achieve the purpose, we proposed simultaneous
analysis for both clustering of variables and low-rank approximation of
correlation matrices corresponding to each class. For the estimation, we
adopt the majorization algorithm based on Pietersz and Groenen (2004)

## Towards A Sparse, Scalable, And Stably Positive Definite (Inverse) Covariance Estimator {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract**</span>: High dimensional covariance estimation and graphical models is a
contemporary topic in statistics and machine learning having widespread
applications. The problem is notoriously difficult in high dimensions as
the traditional estimate is not even positive definite. An important
line of research in this regard is to shrink the extreme spectrum of the
covariance matrix estimators. A separate line of research in the
literature has considered sparse inverse covariance estimation which in
turn gives rise to graphical models. In practice, however, a sparse
covariance or inverse covariance matrix which is simultaneously
well-conditioned and at the same time computationally tractable is
desired. There has been little research at the confluence of these three
topics. In this paper we consider imposing a condition number constraint
to various types of losses used in covariance and inverse covariance
matrix estimation. This extends the approach by Won, Lim, Kim, and
Rajaratnam (2013) on multivariate Gaussian log likelihood. When the loss
function can be decomposed as a sum of an orthogonally invariant
function of the estimate and its inner product with a function of the
sample covariance matrix, we show that a solution path algorithm can be
derived, involving a series of ordinary differential equations. The path
algorithm is at- tractive because it provides the entire family of
estimates for all possible values of the condition number bound, at the
same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper bound.
An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition
number constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing
loss functions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield
non-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this
path algorithm. As a concrete illustration of its practical importance,
we develop an operator-splitting algorithm that imposes a guarantee of
well-conditioning as well as positive definiteness to recently proposed
convex pseudo-likelihood based graphical model selection methods (Zhang
and Zou, 2014; Khare, Oh, and Rajaratnam, 2015).

This is a joint work with Sang-Yun Oh (UC Santa Barbara) and Bala
Rajaratnam (UC Davis).

## Tick-By-Tick Effect On The Inference Of Ultra-High Frequency Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In the inference of ultra-high frequency data, the existing
methods are challenged by the tick-by-tick effect, namely, the
transactions recorded simultaneously at a time point. In this talk, we
will discuss how it influences the estimation of integrated volatility
matrix. The effect of microstructure noise and jumps will be discussed
as well. We propose to use a double-averaging procedure to deal with
these issues. The related asymptotic distribution of the proposed
estimator is established. Even interestingly, the double-averaging
estimator achieves the "oracle"" property, that is, the asymptotic
efficiency is the same as that of the case that the exact trading time
of transactions are fully observed. Simulation studies support the
theoretical results. The estimation procedure is illustrated through a
real data analysis.

## High Mortality Predictions With Lines Or Curves Fitted To Over-Dispersed Exposure-Mortality Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Two types of models are considered and compared. The first is a generalized linear model with logit link, with quasibinomial error, and with weighting function that is designed to give reduced weights at the two ends of the scale, relative to mortalities of around 50%. The other approach is to apply a logit transform, and then use a linear model. The logit transformed data appears, for the data that motivated this paper, consistent with the usual linear model variance homogeneity assumptions. For use of a generalized linear model, the standard linear model diagnostics require modifica- tion so that high mortality points do not unduly distort the smooth that is standardly shown for the scale-location plot. A further issue is that 100% mortality points appear to distort a response that, for mortalities less than 100%, is close to linear on the scale of the link function.

## Lattice Polytope Samplers {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Statistical inverse problems occur when we
wish to learn about some random process that is observed only
indirectly. Inference in such situations typically involves sampling
possible values for the latent variables of interest conditional on the
indirect observations. This talk is concerned with inverse problems for
count data, for which the latent variables are constrained to lie on the
integer lattice within a convex polytope (a bounded multidimensional
polyhedron). An illustrative example arises in transport engineering
where we observe vehicle counts entering or leaving each zone of the
network, then want to sample possible interzonal patterns of traffic
flow consistent with those entry/exit counts. Other problems with this
structure arise when conducting exact inference for contingency tables,
and when analysing capture-recapture data in ecology.

In principle such sampling can be conducted using Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods through a random walk on the lattice polytope, but it is
challenging to design algorithms for doing so that are both
computationally efficient and have guaranteed theoretical properties.
The seminal work of Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998) on Markov bases
addresses some of the theoretical issues, but has significant practical
limitations. In this talk I shall discuss some preliminary findings
based on a more geometric approach to sampler design.

## Statistical Modelling And Analysis Of Cosmic Microwave Background Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is a
remarkable research area in cosmology whose results won two Nobel prizes
in physics in 1978 and 2006 for the discovery of the CMB radiation and
its anisotropy. Spurred on by a wealth of satellite data, intensive
investigations in the past few years have resulted in many relevant
physical and mathematical formalisms to describe and characterise CMB
radiation. At the same time, these investigations have raised a number
of challenges, theoretical and practical. Studies of deviations from
isotropy and Gaussianity, the two fundamental assumptions of
cosmological models of the early Universe, form the core of recent
experimental and theoretical research in cosmology.

Recent results on modelling CMB evolution and approximation of
corresponding random fields will be discussed. Some new approaches to
test Gaussianity using multifractality will be illustrated using CMB
data. Finally, a new R package for CMB data will be presented.

## Measure Of Departure From Marginal Average Point-Symmetry For Two-Way Contingency Tables With Ordered Categories {.unnumbered}

## Sparse Estimates From Dense Precision Matrix Posteriors {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A variety of computationally efficient
Bayesian models for the covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian
distribution are available. However, all produce a relatively dense
estimate of the precision matrix, and are therefore unsatisfactory when
one wishes to use the precision matrix to consider the conditional
independence structure of the data. This talk considers the posterior of
model fit for these covariance models. We then undertake post-processing
of the Bayes point estimate for the precision matrix to produce a sparse
model whose expected fit lies within the upper 95% of the posterior over
fits. Extensions to finding sparse differences between inverse
covariance matrices are also considered. We illustrate our findings with
moderate dimensional data examples from metabolomics.

## Dimension Reduction Strategies For Modeling Bi-Clustered High Dimensional Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Michael Van Supranes and Joseph Ryan Lansangan<br />
University of the Philippines Diliman<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A three-stage framework is developed for fitting a mixture of
regressions for high dimensional data. The method combines a
hierarchical agglomerative grouping algorithm, regression-based
clustering, and a sequential, group-wise sparse estimation called
Layered Elastic Net Selection (LENS). A simulation study is used to
compare the method with LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
predictive accuracy, selection optimality, and clustering accuracy. All
simulation scenarios are high dimensional (n&lt;&lt;p), wherein the best
subset of predictors may or may not vary among clusters. When the group
of most important predictors varies among regression components, the
combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and LENS for mixture of
regressions outperforms LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
prediction and clustering accuracy. Based on simulation, the method
(termed as MixLENS) results to optimal variable selection, and applying
OLS on selected variables results to better prediction and clusters.
OLS-MixLENS may result to a more interpretable model that is as
predictive as a full model (e.g. Mixture of PC Regressions). In general,
MixLENS is likely to select an optimal small subset of predictors for
modeling.

## Computing Entropies With Nested Sampling {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The Nested Sampling algorithm, invented in
the mid-2000s by John Skilling, represented a major advance in Bayesian
computation. Whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are usually
effective for sampling posterior distributions, Nested Sampling also
calculates the marginal likelihood integral used for model comparison,
which is a computationally demanding task. However, there are other
kinds of integrals that we might want to compute. Specifically, the
entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, which quantify
uncertainty and relevance, are all integrals whose form is inconvenient
in most practical applications. I will present my technique, based on
Nested Sampling, for estimating these quantities for probability
distributions that are only accessible via MCMC sampling. This includes
posterior distributions, marginal distributions, and distributions of
derived quantities. I will present an example from experimental design,
where one wants to optimise the relevance of the data for inference of a
parameter.

## Spline-Based Drift Models For High Temperature Operating Life Tests {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Vera Hofer and Thomas Nowak<br />
University of Graz<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the proper operation of semiconductor devices is of crucial importance for the reliability of a vast range of products, issues
concerning quality control are of central relevance to manufacturers.
This quality control task is concerned with high temperature operating
life tests, where devices are exposed to high temperatures, pressures or
humidity, which causes the devices to age artificially fast.

Based on measurements of a random sample of devices, the aim of this
work is to compute tolerance limits, such that all subsequent
measurements during the stress test stay within their predefined
specification limits with a given high probability. These tolerance
limits can then be used by automated test equipment for the quality
control of devices directly from the production line without their prior
exposure to stress test conditions.

In this study, we model the drift behavior of electrical parameters
using linear and cubic hermite splines, which are assumed to resemble
the true, yet unobserved drift behavior. These spline models allow for
the computation of probabilities for an electrical parameter to stay or
leave its specification limits at a given point in time. While a very
restrictive choice of the tolerance limits might achieve a high level of
reliability, the resulting yield loss might get unnecessarily high.
Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
probability for initial measurements to be within the tolerance limits
(in order to minimize the resulting yield loss) and where the
reliability requirement is formulated as a constraint. A derivative-free
search algorithm is proposed for this optimization problem, which is
then used to test the performance and validity of the model.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> High dimensional data exist in digital images, financial time series and
gene expression microarrays. Dealing with high dimensionality has become
a challenge, where the difficulty lies on how to visualize and explore
the high dimensional function or data set. Gene shaving is a statistical
method which is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that has
proven its worth in visualization and exploration of microarray data. In
this paper, the gene shaving algorithm was modified using PCA and Sparse
Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), and the modified algorithms were
explored in terms dimension reduction and clustering of variables in a
more general (not necessarily microarray) high dimensional data
setting.The proposed algorithms were evaluated through a simulation
study. Simulation results suggest that the modified algorithms identify
a singly cluster of variables that may already best explain the
variations in the entire data and/or that already are the most
informative. Also, the algorithms may produce overlapping clusters,
whose variables in the succeeding clusters (other than the first
cluster) are those that may provide information not inherent to the
first cluster. The modified algorithms are thus potential and useful for
exploration and identification of a group of variables worth for further
investigation, as well as clustering/groups of variables for
understanding variable structures/relationships.

## A Simple Method To Construct Confidence Bands In Functional Linear Regression {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper develops a simple method to construct confidence bands,
centered at a principal component analysis (PCA) based estimator, for
the slope function in a functional linear regression model with a scalar
response variable and a functional predictor variable. The PCA- based
estimator is a series estimator with estimated basis functions, and so
construction of valid confidence bands for it is a non-trivial
challenge. We propose a confidence band that aims at covering the slope
function at “most” of points with a prespecified probability (level),
and prove its asymptotic validity under suitable regularity conditions.
Importantly, this is the first paper that derives confidence bands
having theoretical justifications for the PCA-based estimator. We also
propose a practical method to choose the cut-off level used in PCA-based
estimation, and conduct numerical studies to verify the finite sample
performance of the proposed confidence band. Finally, we apply our
methodology to spectrometric data, and discuss extensions of our
methodology to cases where additional vector-valued regressors are
present.

## Separation Of Symmetry For Square Contingency Tables With Ordinal Categories {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Symmetry and asymmetry models are used to
analyze a <span>*square*</span> contingency table with ordinal
categories. Caussinus (1966) pointed out that the symmetry model, which
indicates the structure of symmetry for cell probabilities, could be
separated into the structure of symmetry for odds-ratios and that of
symmetry for marginal distributions. This result provides the reason for
poor fit of the symmetry model when it occurs for a real dataset. Also,
other separations of the symmetry model have been given. For example,
Kateri and Agresti (2007), and Saigusa et al. (2015). In this paper, we
consider the separation of symmetry by using the generalized asymmetry
models. A theorem which the likelihood ratio statistic for testing
goodness of fit of the symmetry model is asymptotically equivalent to
the sum of those for testing the generalized asymmetry model and the
moment equality model under some conditions is given. A simulation study
is presented.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> As big data become more accessible with the boom of data analyzing
software, creating value through analytics has grown in demand. Dealing
with large data sets in anomaly detection problems, accurate tagging of
anomalies is oftentimes lacking and expensive. Unsupervised learning via
clustering analysis can be performed to derive labelled data, but used
alone, is prone to high false alarm rates. We propose a nonparametric
procedure to test presence of clustering effect in a multilevel model
with a large set of predictors. Model estimation is done through
principal component regression (PCR) and two-way analysis-of-variance
(ANOVA), embedded in a backfitting algorithm. Hypothesis test is based
on sieve bootstrap. A simulation study showed that the test is effective
in detecting high clustering effects, and is optimal when sample size
exceeds the number of predictors. The test can be a useful support tool
to help address limitations of existing cluster-based methods in anomaly
detection.
