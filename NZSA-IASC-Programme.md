# Welcomes {-}

## Welcome To The Conference From Ian Westbrooke, NZSA President {-}

Welcome to the 2017 Joint Conference of the NZSA and the IASC-ARS,
 
I bid a special welcome to all who travelled far from countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region and beyond. The New Zealand Statistical Association greatly appreciates the opportunity to share this conference with the International Society for Statistical Computing – Asian Regional Section. The massive growth in interest in data science and analytics demonstrates the need for greater availability of statistical and especially statistical computing expertise and input. This conference provides an opportunity for all of us as statisticians to develop and share the skills we can contribute to the increasing interest and need for our sort of quantitative skills.
 
It is fitting that we are meeting at Auckland University, the original home of R, and the home of its co-founder, Ross Ihaka. Ross has recently retired, and a theme of this conference is in honour of his huge contributions to our field.
 
The conference will be opened by the Dean of Science at the University of Auckland, Professor John Hosking, and the President of the IASC-ARS.  In-between, we have six outstanding keynote speakers who set the framework for an exciting and diverse scientific program. I invite you all to attend presentations on topics familiar to your research and to explore what is done in other areas.
 
We have a very healthy number of students and early career researchers among the more than 300 delegates attending, indicating how popular, important and attractive data rich research continues to be in the years to come.
 
This conference will be a success because of excellent work by many, in particular by Thomas Yee, Ciprian Giurcaneanu and James Curran, who form the local organizing committee. Thanks also to (Chair of the Scientific Program) Ciprian Giurcaneanu, and his team: Rolf Turner and Abhinav Chopra. Thanks finally to Tessa Lloyd-Hagemann, our events coordinator.

Last but not least I thank our sponsors: Minitab, The New Zealand Statistical Association, Harmonic Analytics, SAS, The International Society for Bayesian Analysis, Wiley and the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Statistics,  for their generous financial support. Many aspects of the conference are only possible because of their help,

## Welcome Address From Jung Jin Lee, IASC-ARS Chair-Person {-}


I appreciate your participation for the Joint Meeting of the 10th
Conference of the Asian Regional Section of the International
Association for Statistical Computing and the NZ Statistical
Association, to be held at Auckland University, home of R, from 10 to
14 December 2017. It brings together eminent statisticians and members
of the statistical computing community from Asia, NZ and other
continents to present, discuss, promote and disseminate research and
its applications. I hope you have a great and enjoyable opportunity
for sharing experiences and networking within the R community, as well
as enjoying the beautiful and warm ambience of Auckland.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely
used in dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data. It
identifies principal components by sequentially maximizing the component
score variance around the mean. However, in many applications, one is
interested in capturing the tail variations of the data rather than
variation around the center. To capture the tail characteristics, Tran
et al. (2016), based on an asymmetric $L_2$ norm, proposed principle
expectile components (PECs). In this study, we introduce a new method
called Huber-type principal expectile component (HPEC) using an
asymmetric Huber norm to produce robust PECs. The statistical properties
of HPECs are derived, and a derivative free optimization approach,
particle swarm optimization (PSO), is used to find HPECs. As a
demonstration, HPEC is applied to real and simulated data with
encouraging results.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Obesity is a growing public health problem in New Zealand but the trends of its determinants are unclear. We obtained the confidentialised unit record files (CURF) of the New Zealand Health Surveys (NZHS) from the Statistics New Zealand, containing multiple sets of anonymised individual level data from 2002/03 to 2014/15. We assessed the association between deprivation quintile and compliance with the dietary guideline, and the prevalence of overweight/obesity. For adults, we converted Body Mass Index (BMI) variable into tertiles. Then we regressed the BMI tertiles on deprivation level, ethnicity, age, sex, physical activity, education, smoking status, fruit guideline, vegetable guideline, and household income variables using stepwise ordinal logistic regression with complex survey design. We regressed the BMI categories on deprivation level, ethnicity, age, sex, household income, education, fruit guideline, vegetable guideline, soft drink consumption, and fast food consumption in the child data. We found that people living in the highest deprivation quintile were more likely to be in the higher BMI tertile in adults and BMI category in children compared with those living in the lowest deprivation quintile after adjusting for other confounding variables. For adults and children the ORs (95% CI) were 1.349 (95% CI: 1.240-1.468, p<0.001) and 1.803 (95% CI: 1.531-2.125, p<0.001) respectively. In contrast, the ORs (95% CI) for meeting the fruit and vegetable guidelines in adults were 0.968 (95% CI: 0.933-1.005, p: 0.088) and 1.029 (95%CI: 0.988-1.072, p: 0.172) respectively. The ORs (95% CI) for meeting the fruit and vegetable guidelines in children were 0.931 (95% CI: 0.843-1.029, p: 0.164) and 0.994 (95% CI: 0.908-1.088, p: 0.893) respectively. These results suggest that deprivation independently influences BMI, and the effect of meeting dietary guidelines are confounded by deprivation.

## Calendar-Based Graphics For Visualising People's Daily Schedules {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper describes a `frame_calendar`
function that organises and displays temporal data, collected on
sub-daily resolution, into a calendar layout. Calendars are broadly used
in society to display temporal information, and events. The
`frame_calendar` uses linear algebra on the date variable to create the
layout. It utilises the grammar of graphics to create the plots inside
each cell, and thus synchronises neatly with <span>**ggplot2**</span>
graphics. The motivating application is studying pedestrian behaviour in
Melbourne, Australia, based on counts which are captured at hourly
intervals by sensors scattered around the city. Faceting by the usual
features such as day and month, was insufficient to examine the
behaviour. Making displays on a monthly calendar format helps to
understand pedestrian patterns relative to events such as work days,
weekends, holidays, and special events. The layout algorithm has several
format options and variations. It is implemented in the R package

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We proposed a test for volatility in clustered multiple time series
based on sieve bootstrap. Clustering of observations is intended to
capture contagion effect in multiple time series data, assumed to be
present in the data generating process where the test is based from. We
designed a simulation study to evaluate the test procedure. The method
is further illustrated using data on global stock prices and rice
production among Asian countries. The test is potentially robust to some
distributional assumption but is possibly affected by the nature of
volatility.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggests that a complex phenotype is often affected by many variants with small effects, known as "polygenicity". Tens of thousands of samples are often required to ensure statistical power of identifying these variants with small effects. In this study, we propose a statistical approach, IGESS, to increasing statistical power of identifying risk variants and improving accuracy of risk prediction by integrating individual level genotype data and summary statistics. An efficient algorithm based on variational inference is developed to handle genome-wide-scale analysis. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the advantages of IGESS over the methods which take either individual level data or summary statistics data as input. We applied IGESS to perform integrative analysis of Crohn's Disease from WTCCC and summary statistics from other studies. IGESS was able to significantly increase statistical power of identifying risk variants and improve risk prediction accuracy.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, we propose a new framework to
extract a complete list of the articles written by researchers who
belong to a specific research or educational institute from an academic
document database such as Web of Science and Scopus. In this framework,
it is necessary to perform author name identification because the query
for the database is based on the author’s name to extract documents
written before the author comming to the current institute. The
framework is based on the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is a
kind of topic modeling, and some techniques and indices such as synonym
retrieval and inverse document frequency (IDF) are used for enhancing
the framework.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic
structural mutations with abnormal gene fragment copies. Current CNV
detection algorithms for next generation sequencing (NGS) are developed
for specific genome targets, including whole genome sequencing and
targeted exome sequencing based on the differently data types and
corresponding assumptions. Many whole genome tools assume the continuity
of search space and reads uniform coverage across the genome. However,
these assumptions break down in the exome capture because of
discontinuous segments and exome specific functional biases. In order to
develop a method adapting to both data types, we specify the large
unconsidered genomic fragments as gaps to preserve the truly location
information. A Bayesian hierarchical model was built and an efficient
reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm was
utilized to incorporate the gap information. The performance of gap
settings for the Bayesian procedure was evaluated and compared with
competing approaches using both simulations and real data.

## Clustering Using Nonparametric Mixtures And Mode Identification {.unnumbered}

Shengwei Hu and Yong Wang<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Clustering aims to partition a set of
observations into a proper number of clusters with similar objects
allocated to the same group. Current partitioning methods mainly include
those based on some measure of distance or probability distribution.
Here we propose a mode-based clustering methodology motivated via
density estimation and mode identification procedures. The idea is to
estimate the data-generating probability distribution using a
nonparametric density estimator and then locate the modes of the density
obtained. In the nonparametric mixture models, each mode and the
observations ascend to it correspond to a single cluster. Thus, the
problem of determining the number of clusters can be recast as a mode
merging problem. A criterion of measuring the separability between modes
is also addressed in this work. The most similar modes would be merged
sequentially until the optimal number of clusters is reached. The
performance of the proposed method is investigated on both simulated and
real datasets.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a new Bayesian methodology for
estimating discontinuous functions. In this model, the estimated
function is expressed by the overcomplete representation with multiple
kernels. Therefore, the complex shape of functions can be expressed by
the much smaller number of parameters due to the nature of the
sparseness. It does not need any assumptions about the location of
discontinuities, the smoothness of the function, the number of features.
The form of the function taking all of these into account is determined
naturally by the random Levy measure. Simulation data and real data
analysis show that this model is suitable for fitting discontinuous
functions. We also proved theoretical properties about the support of
the function space having jumps in this paper.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A semiparametric spatiotemporal model is postulated with data measured
at varying frequency. The model optimizes utilization of information
from variables measured at higher frequency by estimating its
nonparametric effect on the response through the backfitting algorithm.
Simulation studies support the optimality of the model over simple
generalized additive model with aggregation of high frequency data. The
method is then used in analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of corn

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Thousands of risk variants underlying complex
phenotypes have been identified in genome-wide association studies
(GWAS). However, there are two major challenges towards fully
characterizing the biological basis of complex diseases. First, many
complex traits are suggested to be highly polygenic, whereas a large
proportion of risk variants with small effects remains unknown. Second,
the functional roles of the majority of GWAS hits in the non-coding
region is largely unclear. In this paper, we propose a latent sparse
mixed model (LSMM) to address the challenges by integrating functional
annotations with summary statistics from GWAS. An efficient variational
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is developed. We conducted
comprehensive simulation studies and then applied it to 30 GWAS of
complex phenotypes integrating 9 genic annotation categories and 127
tissue-specific functional annotations from the Roadmap project. The
results demonstrate that LSMM is not only able to increase the
statistical power to identify risk variants, but also provide a deeper
understanding of genetic architecture of complex traits by detecting
relevant functional annotations.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Nowadays there are many research metrics at
the author-, article-, journal-levels, like the impact factors and
many others. However, none of them possess a universally meaningful
interpretation on the research influence at all levels, not mentioning
that many are subject-biased and consider neighboring relations only.
In this work, we introduce a new network-based research metric called
the network influence. It utilizes all information in the whole
network and it is universal to any levels. Due to its statistical
origin, this metric is computationally efficient and statistically
interpretable even if one applies it to a large-scale network. This
work demonstrates the analysis of networks via network influence using
a large-scale citation database called the Web of Science. By just
considering the articles among statistics community in 2005-2014, the
network influence of all articles are calculated and compared,
resulting in a top-ten important articles that are slightly different
from the list via impact factors. This metric can be easily extended
to author citation network and many similar networks embedded in the

## Estimating Links Of A Network From Time To Event Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper we develop a statistical method for identifying links of a network from time to event data. This method models the hazard function of a node conditional on event time of other nodes, parameterizing the conditional hazard function with the links of the network. It then estimates the hazard function by maximizing a pseudo partial likelihood function with parameters subject to a user‐specified penalty function and additional constraints. To make such estimation robust, it adopts a prespecified risk control on the number of false discovered links by using the Stability Selection method. Simulation study shows that under this hybrid procedure, the number of false discovered links is tightly controlled while the true links are well recovered. We apply our method to estimate a political cohesion network that drives donation behavior of 146 firms from the data collected during the 2008 Taiwanese legislative election. The results show that firms affiliated with elite organizations or firms of monopoly are more likely to diffuse donation behavior. In contrast, firms belonging to technology industry are more likely to act independently on donation.

## Estimation Of A High-Dimensional Covariance Matrix {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The estimation of covariance or precision
(inverse covariance) matrices plays a prominent role in multivariate
analysis. The usual estimator, the sample covariance matrix, is known to
be unstable and ill-conditioned in high-dimensional setting. In the past
two decades, various methods have been developed to give a stable and
well-conditioned estimator and they have their own advantages and
disadvantages. We will review some of the most popular methods and
describe a new method to estimate the correlation matrix and hence the
covariance matrix using the empirical Bayes method. Similar to many
element-wise methods in the literature, we also assume that the elements
in a correlation matrix are independent of each other. We use the fact
that the elements in a sample correlation matrix can be approximated by
the same one-parameter normal distribution with unknown means , along
with the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation to give a new
estimator of the correlation matrix. Preliminary simulation results show
that the new estimator has some advantages over various thresholding
methods in estimating sparse covariance matrices.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In spite of recent growing interest in
applying the von-Mises distribution to circular data in various
scientific fields, researches on the parameter estimation are
surprisingly sparse. The standard estimators are the MLE and the maximum
marginal likelihood estimator (Schou 1978). Although Bayesian estimators
are promising, it looks that they have not been fully developed. We
propose the posterior mean of the canonical parameter, instead of the
mean parameter, under the reference prior. This estimator satisfies an
optimality property, and performs favorably for wide ranges of true
parameters. Extensive simulation studies yield that the risks of the
proposed estimator are significantly small, compared with the existing
estimators. An interesting finding is that the estimating function for
the dispersion parameter behaves reasonably. Notable advantages of the
present approach are its straightforward extensions to various
procedures, including Bayesian estimator under an informative prior
based on the reference prior. The proposed estimator is examined by
applying to practical datasets.

a model, e.g., autoregressive model, transfer function model. A
change-point is considered to exist if any of the model parameters is

existence of a change-point (assuming that location of the change is

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Results from Genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) suggest that a complex phenotype is often affected by many
variants with small effects, known as “polygenicity”. Tens of thousands
of samples are often required to ensure statistical power of identifying
these variants with small effects. However, it is often the case that a
research group can only get approval for the access to individual-level
genotype data with a limited sample size (e.g., a few hundreds or
thousands). Meanwhile, pleiotropy is a pervasive phenomenon in genetics
whereby a DNA variant influences multiple traits, and summary statistics
for genetically related traits (e.g., autoimmune diseases or psychiatric
disorders) are becoming publicly available. The sample sizes associated
with the summary statistics data sets are usually quite large. How to
make the most efficient use of existing abundant data resources largely
remains an open problem.

In this study, we propose a statistical approach, LEP, to increasing
statistical power of identifying risk variants and improving accuracy of
risk prediction by integrating individual level genotype data and
summary statistics by veraging leiotropy. An efficient algorithm based
on variational inference is developed to handle the genome-wide
analysis. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the
advantages of LEP over the methods which take either individual-level
data or summary statistics data as input. We applied LEP to perform
integrative analysis of several auto-immune diseases from WTCCC and
summary statistics from other studies. LEP was able to significantly
increase the statistical power of identifying risk variants and improve
the risk prediction accuracy by jointly analyzing autoimmune diseases.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Time series forecasting is a decade-long
research and which is being evolving day by day. Due to the recent
advancement is deep learning technique many of the complex problems have
been solved using deep learning. Deep learning techniques have shown
tremendous better performance in supervised learning problem. One of the
reasons for this success is the ability of deep feedforward network
methods to learn multiple feature interaction for a single instance.
However, the time-dependent nature not being captured by deep
feedforward network till the evolution of RNN(recurrent neural network)
and LSTM(long short term memory) network architecture. This paper
reveals the success of LSTM time series in comparison with ARIMA and
other standard approaches for time series modeling. A sensitivity
analysis is also conducted to explore the effect of hyper parameter
tuning on LSTM model to reduce the time series forecasting error. We
also derive practical advice from our empirical results for those
interested in getting most out of LSTM time series for modern time
series forecasting.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A genetic linkage map shows the relative
position of and genetic distance between markers, positions of the
genome that exhibit variation, and underpins the study of species’
genomes in a number of scientific applications. Genetic maps are
constructed by tracking the transmission of genetic information from
individuals to their offspring, which is frequently modelled using a
hidden Markov model (HMM) since only the expression and not the
transmission of genetic information is observed. However, constructing
genetic maps with data generated using the latest sequencing technology
is complicated by the fact that some observations are only partially
observed which, if unaccounted for, typically results in inflated
estimates. We extend the HMM to model partially observed information by
including an additional layer of latent variables. In addition, we
investigate several different approaches for computing confidence
intervals of the genetic map estimates obtained from the extended HMM.
Results show that our model is able to produce accurate genetic map
estimates, even in situations where a large proportion of the data is
only partially observed. Our methodology has been implemented in the R
package GusMap.

## A Simple Method For Grouping Patients Based On Historical Doses {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Monitoring dose patterns over time helps physicians and patients learn
more about metabolic change, disease evolution, etc. One way to turn
such longitudinal data into clinically useful information is through
cluster analysis, which aims to separate the “profiles of doses” among
patients into homogeneous subgroups. Different doses patterns reflect
heterogeneity in patients’ characteristics and effectiveness of therapy.
However, not all patients were prescribed at regular time points, and
missing values seems ubiquitous if one aligns records at distinct time
points. Moreover, a few outliers may heavily influence the estimation
for within and/or between variations of clusters, making the distinction
among clusters blurred. In this study, a simple method based on a novel
pairwise dissimilarity is proposed, which also serves as a screen tool
to detect potential outliers. We use smoothing splines, handling data
observed either at regular or irregular time points, and measure the
dissimilarity between patients based on pairwise varying curve estimates
with commutation of smoothing parameters. It takes into account the
estimation uncertainty and is not strongly affected by outliers. The
effectiveness of our proposal is shown by simulations comparing it to
other dissimilarity measures and by a real application to methadone
dosage maintenance levels.

estimated using the two procedures: based on an imbedded restricted
maximum likelihood (REML) and nonparametric regression (smoothing
splines) estimation into the backfitting framework (ARMS); and infusing
bootstrap into the ARMS (B-ARMS). The heterogeneous effect of covariates
across the groups is postulated to affect the response through a
nonparametric function to mitigate overparameterization. Using

(and estimation procedures) in increasing predictive ability and
stabilizing variance components estimates even for small sample size and
with minimal covariate effect, and regardless of whether the model is

## Adaptive False Discovery Rate Regression With Application In Integrative Analysis Of Large-Scale Genomic Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recent international projects, such as the
Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, the Roadmap project and
the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, have generated vast
amounts of genomic annotation data, e.g., epigenome and transcriptome.
There is great demanding of effective statistical approaches to
integrate genomic annotations with the results from genome-wide
association studies. In this talk, we introduce a statistical framework,
named AdaFDR, for integrating multiple annotations to characterize
functional roles of genetic variants that underlie human complex
phenotypes. For a given phenotype, AdaFDR can adaptively incorporates
relevant annotations for prioritization of genetic risk variants,
allowing nonlinear effects among these annotations, such as interaction
effects between genomic features. Specifically, we assume that the prior
probability of a variant associated with the phenotype is a function of
its annotations $F(X)$, where $X$ is the collection of the annotation
status and $F(X)$ is an ensemble of decision trees, i.e.,
$F(X) = \sum_k f_k(X)$ and $f_k(X)$ is a shallow decision tree. We have
developed an efficient EM-Boosting algorithm for model fitting, where a
shallow decision tree grows in a gradient-Boosting manner (Friedman J.
2001) at each EM-iteration. Our framework inherits the nice property of
gradient boosted trees: (1) The gradient accent property of the Boosting
algorithm naturally guarantees the convergence of our EM-Boosting
algorithm. (2) Based on the fitted ensemble $\hat{F}(X)$, we are able to
rank the importance of annotations, measure the interaction among
annotations and visualize the model via partial plots (Friedman J.
2008). Using AdaFDR, we performed integrative analysis of genome-wide
association studies on human complex phenotypes and genome-wide
annotation resources, e.g., Roadmap epigenome. The analysis results
revealed interesting regulatory patterns of risk variants. These
findings deepen our understanding of genetic architectures of complex
phenotypes. The statistical framework developed here is also broadly
applicable to many other areas for integrative analysis of rich data
sets.

“new usage method” (Schumpeter 1912). In recent years, the promotion of
the Innovation has been strongly encouraged. In the field of research,
attempts are also being made to create new value through connection
between those fields. Moreover, along with the move to promote
integration among these research fields, research is being conducted to
grasp and promote the degree of them. In this research, for the purpose
of providing indices for measuring the degree of them, we show indices
quantitatively indicating the degree of fusion in different fields and
the distance between the fields. Also, we have try to present indices
for grasping the whole image based on the random graph.

## Vector Generalized Linear Time Series Models {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the introduction of the ARMA class in
the early 1970s many time series (TS) extensions have been proposed,
e.g., vector ARMA and GARCH-type models for heteroscedasticity. The
result has been a plethora of models having pockets of substructure but
little overriding framework. In this talk we propose a class of TS
models called Vector Generalized Linear Time Series Models (VGLTSM),
which can be thought of as multivariate generalized linear models
directed towards time series data. The crucial VGLM ideas are constraint
matrices, vector responses and covariate-specific linear predictors, and
estimation by iteratively reweighted least squares and Fisher scoring.
The only addition to the VGLM framework is a log-likelihood that depends
on past values. We show how several popular sub-classes of TS models are
accommodated as special cases of VGLMs, as well as new work that
broadens TS modelling even more. Algorithmic details of its
implementation in , and properties such as stationarity, parameters
depending on covariates, expected information matrices and cointegrated
TS are surveyed.

## Local Canonical Correlation Analysis For Multimodal Labeled Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In supervised learning, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is widely
used for dimension reduction problems. When using dimension reduction
methods, researchers should always aim to preserve the data structure in
a low dimensional space. However, if the obtained data are assumed to be
multimodal labeled data, that is, each cluster can be subdivided into
several latent clusters, CCA is rarely able to preserve the data
structure in a low dimensional space.

In this study, we propose local CCA (LCCA) for multimodal labeled data.
This method is based on local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA)
(Sugiyama, 2007). We do not employ the same local covariance matrix of
the explanatory variables as under LFDA, which uses a local
between-group variance matrix and a local within-group variance matrix.
Instead, in our proposed method, we use a covariance matrix of the
explanatory variables as well as a weighted affinity matrix. The
usefulness of LCCA in data visualization and clustering is then
demonstrated by simulation studies.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recently, deep learning techniques have shown
remarkably strong performance in problems involving unstructured data
(ex. text, image, and video). One of the reasons for this success is the
ability of deep learning methods to learn multiple levels of abstraction
and feature interaction. However, the advantages of using deep learning
techniques for structured/ event/transactional data has not been studied
in detail. The purpose of this paper is to review the advantages and
limitations of using deep feed forward networks on structured data. This
is achieved by comparing the performance of deep feed forward networks
with conventional machine learning techniques applied on a large
structured dataset for classification problem. The paper also describes
methodologies for optimizing the deep feed forward networks to achieve
better accuracy and different approaches to reduce over fitting for deep
feed forward network. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the
effect of hyper parameter tuning on model performance. We also derive
practical advice from our extensive empirical results for those
interested in getting most out of deep feed forward networks for real
world settings.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, we propose a new clustering
method to measure influence of papers in all areas of science. To see
structure of entire relationship we apply stochastic block model (SBM)
on big scale citation network data. SBM generates a matrix which divides
several blocks which represent relationship among research fields. We
show this matrix can be used to visual exploratory analysis. When lists
of papers are mapped this matrix we can get useful information by varied
locations in visually. Elastic Map is used as dimension reduction method
to calculate scalar value onto onto the corresponding principal points
of each papers. We demonstrate that this projection score is can be used
to evaluate divergence impact of papers across all field. To illustrate
one application of our method, we analyze 450k+ articles published
between 1981 and 2016 Web of Science data. In this beta version of our

## Canonical Covariance Analysis For Mixed Numerical And Categorical Three-Way Three-Mode Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Three-mode three-way data (objects $\times$
variable $\times$ conditions) have been observed in many areas of
research. For example, panel data often include values for the same
objects and variables at different times. Given two three-mode three-way
data sets, we often investigate two types of factors: common factors,
which show the relationships between the two data sets, and unique
factors, which represent the uniqueness of each data set. In light of
this, canonical covariance analysis has been proposed. However, these
datasets often have numerical and categorical variables simultaneously.
Many multivariate methods for two three-mode thee-way data sets assume
that the data has numerical variables only. To overcome this problem, we
propose three-mode three-way canonical covariance analysis with
numerical and categorical variables. We use an optimal scaling method
(for example, Yong (1987)) for the quantification of categorical data
because the values of a categorical variable could not be compared with
the value of a numerical variable.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The matching pursuit algorithm (MPA) is an
efficient solution for high dimensional variable selection (Bühlmann and
van de Geer, 2011). There is, however, no widely accepted stopping rule
for MPA. (Li et al., 2017) have given novel stopping rules based on
information theoretic criteria (ITC). All of these ITC are based on the
degrees of freedom (df) of the hat matrix which maps the data vector to
its estimate. We derive some properties of the hat matrix when MPA is
used. These allow us to give an upper bound on the possible increase in
df between successive MPA iterations. A simulation study with data
generated from different models compares the mean integrated square
error of the different ITC and cross validation (Sancetta, 2016).

## Estimating Causal Structures For Continuous And Discrete Variables {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Structural equation models have been used extensively for continuous
variable data to find causal structures. In such a framework, the Linear
Non- Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) could enable finding a whole causal
model (Shimizu et al., 2006). However, in many desciplines, the data
include both continuous and discrete variables. LiNGAM could fail to
capture the actual causal relationship for such data because it handles
both discrete and continuous variables as continuous. Therefore, it is
necessary to improve the estimation method for causal structures in such
conditions.

In this study, we propose a method to find causal structures for
continuous and discrete variables. To overcome the problems of the
existing method, we use the Link function. Using simulation studies, we
show that the proposed method performs more efficiently for data that
includes continuous and discrete variables.

## Incorporating Genetic Networks Into Case-Control Association Studies With High-Dimensional DNA Methylation Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In human genetic association studies with
high-dimensional microarray data, it has been well known that
statistical methods utilizing prior biological network knowledge such as
genetic pathways and signaling pathways can outperform other methods
that ignore genetic network structures. In recent epigenetic research on
case-control association studies, relatively many statistical methods
have been proposed to identify cancer-related CpG sites and the
corresponding genes from high-dimensional DNA methylation data. However,
most of existing methods are not able to utilize genetic networks
although methylation levels among linked genes in the networks tend to
be highly correlated with each other. In this article, we propose new
approach that combines independent component analysis with network-based
regularization to identify outcome-related genes for analysis of
high-dimensional DNA methylation data. The proposed approach first
captures gene-level signals from multiple CpG sites using independent
component analysis and then regularizes them to perform gene selection
according to given biological network information. In simulation
studies, we demonstrated that the proposed approach overwhelms other
statistical methods that do not utilize genetic network information in
terms of true positive selection. We also applied it to the 450K DNA
methylation array data of the four breast invasive carcinoma cancer
subtypes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.

is a naive one, and the second term is adaptive to the model as if the
model were univariate. It is consistent and can detect local alternative
at a fast rate. Monte Carlo method is used to find the critical value
under null hypothesis. Simulation studies show the performance of our

Bioinformatics Training & Education Center (BITEC) for medical doctors
supported from Ministry of Welfare and Public Health Korea. This project
was initiated by Dept. of Bioinformatics & Statistics KNOU and Dept. of
Medical Informatics of SNU Medical College for training medical doctors.
The high penetration rates of mobile phone subscriptions and the rapid
growing of handheld users show that it is viable for making inroads
towards the usage of mobile devices as an alternative learning mode for
distance learning. The mobile learning initiative is aimed to encourage
learning and interactions in distance learning communities aiming to
bridge the transactional distances faced by the learners and adopt
mobility as the key tool in Bioinformatics courses delivery. The BITEC
m-Learning initiative focuses on introducing Bioinformatics using
handheld devices to be made easily accessible through the use of mobile
devices for ODL Bioinformatics learners who are very busy medical
doctors in ubiquitous learning environment. The m-Learning approach is
considered as a learning alternative to support distance learners mainly
working doctors and medical researchers in Korea. This research paper
discusses the implementation of the mobile e-Book approach which has
better affordable, accessible and flexible educational media.

## On Optimal Group Testing Designs: Prevalence Estimation, Cost Considerations, And Dilution Effects {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Group testing has been used for decades to
estimate the prevalence of a rare disease when samples from multiple
subjects can be pooled and tested as a group. A group testing design is
specified by the support points (distinct group sizes) and their
corresponding frequencies. In this series of works, we construct locally
optimal approximate designs for group testing with uncertain error
rates, where the goal is to maximize the precision of the prevalence
estimate. We also provide a guaranteed algorithm based on the
approximate theory for constructing exact designs for practical use. Our
simulated examples based on a Chlamydia study in the United States show
that the proposed design outperforms competing designs, and its
performance is quite stable to the working parameters. We then extend
the framework to accommodate two features likely to be encountered in
real-world studies. We develop optimal budgeted-constrained designs,
where both subjects and tests incur costs, and the error rates of the
the assay are linked to the group sizes, allowing dilution effects to
reduce the test performance. (Work done jointly with M.-N. L. Huang, K.
Shedden, and W. K. Wong.)

## The Use Of Bayesian Networks In Grape Yield Prediction {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The requirement for predictions to be made earlier in the growing season
has become more important, as the opportunity to plan for the wine
production and export earlier in the season becomes desirable. The issue
with this is there is less information available to those wishing to
make early predictions. The analysis in this paper implements a double
sigmoidal curve to model the grape growth over the growing season, as
this is typically used in agriculture.

In order to conduct prediction in this study, a Bayesian Network is
considered. This allows the opportunity to consider the knowledge of
experts in the field, where grape growers would know the growth
behaviour of the grapes, as well as using new data to update the
Bayesian Network. This information is then implemented in the form of
priors, which involves estimating the parameters of the aforementioned
double sigmoidal model. Sensitivity Analysis is done in this research,
which looks at the impact of prior assumptions (or lack thereof) from
experts. Examinations are also made of the value of adding information
to the model, as it can be determined whether the precision in the
predictions improves as a result of adding data. The results in this
analysis are based off simulation studies.

## Pattern Prediction For Time Series Data With Change Points {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Satoshi Goto and Hiroshi Yadohisa<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recently, there have been various types of time series data, such as
daily stock prices and Web-click logs, that have complicated the
structure. In several cases, because of the complexity, time series data
cannot satisfy the stationary process assumption. REGIMECAST (Matsubara
and Sakura, 2016) has been proposed as a method to forecast time series
data. It is useful for capturing changes in time series patterns and
representing the non-linear system. However, it cannot adequately
represent time series data after radical changes. Generally, radical
changes in time series data can be detected using existing methods, such
as change-point detection and anomaly detection. These methods are
rarely used for forecasting time series data, although these data often
show different behaviors after radical changes.

In this study, we propose a method that can forecast future time series
data after events involving radical changes. The method has two
features: i) appropriate pattern discovery, as it recognizes the
appropriate learning section with change-point detection, and ii)
flexible representation, as it represents non-stationary processes with
a non-linear state space model. We also provide empirical examples using
a variety of real datasets.

## Test For Genomic Imprinting Effects On The X Chromosome {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic
phenomenon that the expression of an allele copy depends on its parental
origin. This mechanism has been found to play an important role in many
diseases. Methods for detecting imprinting effects have been developed
primarily for autosomal markers. However, no method is available in the
literature to test for imprinting effects on the X chromosome.
Therefore, it is necessary to suggest methods for detecting such
imprinting effects. In this talk, the parental-asymmetry test on X the
chromosome (XPAT) is first developed to test for imprinting for
qualitative traits in the presence of association, based on family trios
each with both parents and their affected daughter. Then, we propose
1-XPAT to tackle parent-daughter pairs, each with one parent and his/her
affected daughter. By simultaneously considering family trios and
parent-daughter pairs, C-XPAT is constructed to test for imprinting.
Further, we extend the proposed methods to accommodate complete (with
both parents) and incomplete (with one parent) nuclear families having
multiple daughters of which at least one is affected. Simulations are
conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods under
different settings. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
methods control the size well, irrespective of the inbreeding
coefficient in females being zero or nonzero. By incorporating
incomplete nuclear families, C-XPAT is more powerful than XPAT using
only complete nuclear families. For practical use, these proposed
methods are applied to analyze the rheumatoid arthritis data.

## Fluctuation Reduction Of Value-At-Risk Estimation And Its Applications {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Shih-Feng Huang<br />
National University of Kaohsiung<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a fundamental tool for
risk management and is also associated with the capital requirements of
banks. Banks need to adjust their capital levels for satisfying the
Basel Capital Accord. On the other hand, managements do not like to
change the capital levels too often. To achieve a balance, this study
proposes an approach to reduce the fluctuation of VaR estimation. The
first step is to fit a time series model to the underlying asset returns
and obtain the conventional VaR process. A new VaR (NVaR) estimation of
the conventional VaR process is then determined by applying change-point
detection algorithms and a proposed combination scheme. The capital
levels computed from the NVaR process are capable of satisfying the
Basel Accord and reducing the fluctuation of capital levels
simultaneously. To apply the proposed method to the calculation of
future capital requirements, an innovative approach for NVaR prediction
is also proposed by incorporating the concept of CUSUM control charts.
The return processes of 30 companies on the list of S$\&$P 500 from 2005
to 2016 are employed for our empirical investigation. Numerical results
indicate that the proposed NVaR prediction is capable of satisfying the
Basel Accord and reducing the fluctuation of capital requirements
simultaneously by using a comparable average amount of capital
requirements to the conventional VaR estimator.

sampling is informative, that is, the model holding for the population
is different from the model holding for the (biased) sample. Ignoring
the sampling design and just fitting the mixed model to the sample
distribution will lead to biased inference. Although both the model and
sampling involve “clusters”, the model clusters and sample clusters need
not be the same. I will use a pairwise composite likelihood method to
estimate the parameters of the population model under this setting. In
particular, consistency and asymptotic normality can be established.
Variance estimation in this problem is challenging. I will talk about a

## Regression With Random Effects For Analysing Correlated Survival Data: Application To Disease Recurrences {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

Griffith University<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Correlated failure time data arise in many
biomedical studies, due to multiple occurrences of the same disease in
an individual patient. To account for this correlation phenomenon, we
formulate a random effect (frailty) survival model with an
autoregressive (AR) covariance structure and adopt the generalized
linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology for estimation of regression and
variance component parameters. A more general case of the problem is
also considered via a multilevel random effect approach where the
correlation of survival times is induced by a hierarchical clustering
structure, such as the appearances of repeated failures in patients from
the same hospital in a multicentre clinical trial setting. Our modelling
problem is used to investigate prognostic and treatment effects on
disease relapses in two data sets, (1) tumour recurrences in bladder
cancer patients and (2) recurrent infections in children with chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD). Using the first data set, the effect of
treatment thiotepa was found to be insignificant but demonstrated an
effect in reducing tumour recurrences with adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)
of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29-1.16, p=0.124). The initial number of tumours
(AHR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.47, p=0.004) had significant positive effect
but the effect of the size of the largest initial tumour was
insignificant. In the case of the CGD data, treatment gamma interferon
showed a significant decreasing effect (AHR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.56,
p$<$0.001) on the incidence of recurrent infections. In addition, age
effect was significant (AHR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81-1.0, p=0.042). Pattern
of inheritance, height, weight, sex, use of corticosteroids and
prophylactic antibiotics did not exhibit significant association with
recurrent infections. The appropriateness of our modelling methodology
is investigated in a simulation study. The simulation results show that
parameters are satisfactorily estimated in the special case where AR
random effect is merely used. However, in the multilevel context bias in
the variance parameter of random hospital effect increases as the true
magnitude of variation in hospital effects increases.

symptoms, neurocognitive problems and mental health disorders such as
anxiety. Cognitive impairments can impact on all areas of an
individual’s work, home and social life and are important to understand
and predict overall recovery. These outcomes may be in part be
determined by genetic variants that influence the molecular and
physiological response of the brain to damage, as well as determining
pre-injury reserve and vulnerability to co-morbidities.

A number of studies have examined the relationship between genetic
variants and outcomes following TBI. Most have examined groups with
moderate to severe injury and are limited by small sample sizes,
selection biases, failed to correct for ethnic factors, and have
evaluated outcomes at various time points, making comparison between
studies difficult.

Using the population-based study of TBI in NZ (BIONIC) we analysed the
association between cognitive outcomes with 18 genetic markers
(SNPs-single nucleotide polymorphisms) from 12 genes previously studied
in relation with TBI; FAAH, GAD1, WWC1, CHMR2, ANKK1, BDNF, NGB, BCL2,
APOE, S100B, HMOX1 and COMT in a sample of 183 European and 76 Maori
adults. We used the CNS-Vital Signs (computerised neurocognitive test
battery) to provide 11 measures of cognitive functioning, memory and
attention collected at baseline, 1-, 6-, 12- and 48 months post-injury.

ANCOVA models were used to identify the association between time, SNP
(modelled as major, heterozygous and minor alleles) and SNP by time
effect for each CNS-Vital Signs outcome. Statistically significant
findings were observed in both European and Maori samples for being
associated with the same CNS-Vital Signs outcome for rs8191992 (CHMR2),
rs4680 (rs4680), rs2071746 (HMOX1) and rs17071145 (WWC1).

A linear mixed effects model was utilised to analyse each individual’s
natural cognitive recovery trajectory over time. The individuals’ age,
gender, whether or not this was their first TBI, the severity level of
the mild TBI (low, medium or high) and SNP were all included in the
model as covariates.

Regression analyses identified the following SNPs to be statistically
associated with several CNS-Vital Signs outcomes; rs8191992 (CHMR2) was
shown to be associated with attention, neurocognition, composite memory,
executive functioning as well as processing and psychomotor speed in
Europeans.

Whilst rs3798178 (GAD1) was associated with two domains of attention,
neurocognition and three domains of memory (composite, visual and
working) in Maori. We found rs3791879 was associated with increased
attention and neurocognition in our European sample.

Furthermore, the minor alleles of rs11604671 (ANKK1) were associated
with poorer cognitive recovery (compared to those with homozygous major
alleles) for two domains of attention, executive functioning, processing
speed, social acuity and working memory over time in Maori. We found
rs11604671 was associated with reduced executive functioning and
processing speed in our European sample

Unlike other genetic studies on TBI patients, our study investigated
several different genetic variants in a larger ethnically diverse
population sample of individuals with primarily mild TBI. Although our
findings agreed with previous literature for genetic associations for
cognitive recovery post-injury, for the first time, we were able to
identify ethnic differences in specific genetic markers determining
specific cognitive outcomes in European and Maori people with TBI.
Further large TBI population based cohort studies are warranted to
replicate these genetic associations, both locally and globally in order
to better understand the differences underlying an individual’s outcome
trajectory and inform more effective treatment strategies.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Vector autoregression (VAR) model is powerful
in economic data analysis because it can be used to analyze several
different time series data simultaneously. However, in VAR model, we
need to deal with the huge coefficient dimensionality and it would be
caused some computational problems for coefficient inference. To reduce
the dimensionality, we could take some model structures into account
based on the prior knowledge. In this paper, several group structures of
the coefficient matrices are considered. Due to different types of VAR
structures, corresponding MCMC algorithms are proposed to generate
posterior samples for making inference of the structure selection.
Simulation studies and a real example are used to show the performances
of the proposed Bayesian approaches.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> For some scientists, seeing a statistician in the corridor is the
equivalent of coming face to face with the grim reaper. They fear being
beaten over the head with a Stat101 textbook as you try to hammer into
them the importance of replication, randomisation or an appropriate
sample size. Many scientists would rather blunder through on their own
than admit to the statistician that they don’t understand the
ins-and-outs of ANOVA. So we end up with peer reviewed research with
badly interpreted p-values and underwhelming Excel graphs despite the
existence of more elegant solutions. As ambassadors of statistical
rigour, we are the ones who can turn this around. When the scientists
won’t come to us, how can we improve data usage short of chasing
scientists down corridors with textbooks? I will give examples of how to
Talk Data with scientists to encourage their statistical awakening. In
the right context, even the most puritanical scientists can become more
comfortable Talking Data. They may even find they enjoy it!

## Smooth Nonparametric Regression Under Shape Restrictions {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Shape-restricted regression, in particular
under isotonicity and convexity(concavity) constraints, has many
practical applications. Traditional nonparametric methods to the problem
using least squares or maximum likelihood result in discrete step
functions or nonsmooth piecewise linear functions, which are
unsatisfactory both predictively and visually. In this talk, we describe
a new, smooth, nonparametric estimator under the above-mentioned shape
restrictions. In particular, the discrete measures that are inherent in
the previous estimators are replaced with continuous ones. A new
algorithm that can rapidly find the corresponding estimate will also be
presented. Numerical studies show that the new estimator outperforms
major existing methods in almost all cases.

## Elastic-Band Transform: A New Approach To Multiscale Visualization {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper presents a new transformation
technique for multiscale visualization of one-dimensional data such as
time series and functional data under the concept of the scale-space
approach. The proposed method uses a range of regular observations (eye
scanning) with varying intervals. The results, termed ‘elastic-band
transform’ can be considered as a collection of observations over
different intervals of viewing. It is motivated by a way that human
looks at an object such as a sequence of data repeatedly in order to
overview a global structure of it as well as find some specific features
of it. Some measures based on elastic-bands are discussed for describing
characteristics of data, and two-dimensional visualizations induced by
the measures are developed for understanding and detecting important
structures of data. Furthermore, some statistical applications are
studied.

## Flight To Relative Safety: Learning From A No-Arbitrage Network Of Yield Curves Model Of The Euro Area {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper develops a no-arbitrage network of yield curves model for the
euro area to study the joint dynamics of and risk transmission across
yield curves of different economies. The model nests 1+M yield curves of
a benchmark country and M periphery countries with 3+(2+M) state
factors. The benchmark curve is spanned by three yield factors, which
are also common basis for all curves. Periphery yield spreads are
spanned by three factors, including two common risk factors related to
market liquidity risk and common sovereign credit risk, and a
country-specific risk factor. Parsimony can be guaranteed as M increases
with additional yield curve data, and factors can be strongly identified
with structural restrictions under the no-arbitrage conditions. We
estimate a 1+5 yield curves model for Germany and GIIPS countries using
weekly data from 2009 to 2016. The results show that, the German yields
enjoy a ‘flight to liquidity’ effect under a liquidity shock, which
pushes down German yields while driving up periphery spreads. However,
in response to a shock of common sovereign credit risk, yields of all
countries, including Germany, tend to increase immediately and
persistently. The weaker is a country’s economic fundamental, the higher
its risk exposure to shocks. Though spillover effects among periphery
curves are generally positive, when a Greek shock bursts, the Italian
risk factor may be temporarily mitigated due to its relative stronger
economy. The network model can be adapted with a time-varying parameter
VAR to monitor evolving contributions of factors.

## Robustness Of Temperature Reconstruction For Past 500 Years {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Temperature reconstruction is vital to
studies of climate change. Instrumental records are only available back
to 19th century, too short to describe changes that occur over hundreds
or thousands of years. Fortunately, nature environmental clues (such as
tree rings, pollens and ice cores) can be pieced together to reconstruct
unrecorded temperatures. We use tree-ring width to study summer
temperature in Northern Sweden for past 500 years. Previous work has
shown the predictions to be sensitive to model assumptions. We gain a
new insight into this problem by attempting to separately estimate
aspects of the process that are robustly estimated. One of these are the
years in which the climate is colder or warmer than recent observations.
We implement this by considering hidden Markov models on the partially
observed temperature series. The model is fitted using Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo in Stan.

## Nonparametric Causal Inference By The Kernel Method {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Rubin causal model is a statistical model to
estimate the effect of a treatment on the outcome based on the framework
of potential outcomes. To estimate a causal effect based on Rubin causal
model, propensity score plays a central role. In particular, matching
and weighting methods like Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPWE)
and Doubly-Robust estimator based on the estimated propensity score are
widely used. Despite its popularity, it was pointed out that model
misspecification of the propensity score can result in substantial bias
of the resulting estimators of a causal effect and potential outcomes.
It is possible to estimate propensity score in nonparametric ways or
machine learning methods to avoid model misspecification. However, it
doesn’t work well in most situations due to following reasons: 1) Curse
of dimensionality. 2) They only aim at an accuracy of classification and
don’t optimize the covariate balancing. To overcome the problems above,
we propose a new estimator of propensity score using kernel mean
embeddings of conditional distributions. Although our proposal is
completely nonparametric, our estimator has a dimensionality-independent
rate of convergence. Using kernel measures of conditional independence
for model selection, our estimator can also correct the bias that arises
from the imbalance of covariates. In numerical simulations, we confirm
that our method can reduce the bias in misspecified settings. We also
describe several asymptotic properties of our estimator.

<span>**Abstract**</span>: Partial Least Squares (PLS) methods have been
heavily exploited to analyse the association between two blocs of data.
These powerful approaches can be applied to data sets where the number
of variables is greater than the number of observations and in presence
of high collinearity between variables. Different sparse versions of PLS
have been developed to integrate multiple data sets while simultaneously
selecting the contributing variables. Sparse modelling is a key factor
in obtaining better estimators and identifying associations between
multiple data sets. The cornerstone of the sparsity version of PLS
methods is the link between the SVD of a matrix (constructed from
deflated versions of the original matrices of data) and least squares
minimisation in linear regression. We present here an accurate
description of the most popular PLS methods, alongside their
mathematical proofs. A unified algorithm is proposed to perform all four
types of PLS including their regularised versions. Various approaches to
decrease the computation time are offered, and we show how the whole
procedure can be scalable to big data sets.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Currently, it is becoming easier to analyze
the various types of spatial data and express them visually on a map.
However, it is still difficult to estimate the location of spatial
clusters based on statistical evidence. The spatial scan statistic
(Kulldorff 1997), which is based on the idea of maximizing the
likelihood of cluster, has been widely used for spatial cluster
detection method. It is important how effectively and efficiently we
find a cluster whose likelihood is high, and to find such a cluster,
some scan approaches are proposed. However, most of them are limited in
the shape of a detected cluster, or need an unrealistic computational
time if the data size is too large. The zero-suppressed binary decision
diagram (ZDD) (Minato, 1993), one approach to frequent item set mining,
enables us to extract all of the potential cluster areas at a realistic
computational cost. In this study, we try a new way of spatial cluster
detection method to detect a cluster with truly highest likelihood by
applying the ZDD, and by using them, we compare and evaluate the
performance of the existing scan methods.

## Scoring Rules For Prediction And Classification Challenges {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Prediction and classification challenges have
become an exciting and useful feature of the statistical and machine
learning community. For example, Good Judgement Open asks forecasters to
predict the probability of particular world events, and Kaggle.com
regularly sets classification challenges. Challenge organizers typically
publish a ranked list of the leading submissions and, ultimately,
announce the winner of the challenge. However, in order for such a
competition to be considered worth entering, the challenge organizers
must be seen to evaluate the submissions in a fair and open manner.
Scoring rules were devised precisely to solve this problem. Crucially,
<span>*proper*</span> scoring rules elicit honest statements of belief
about the outcome. If the challenge organizers use a proper scoring rule
to evaluate submissions, a competitor’s expected score under their true
belief will be optimized by actually quoting that belief to the
organizers. A proper scoring rule therefore rules out any possibility of
a competitor gaming the challenge. We discuss a class of proper scoring
rules called linear scoring rules that are specifically adapted to
probabilistic binary classification. When applied in competition
situations, we show that all linear scoring rules essentially balance
the needs of organizers and competitors. We also develop scoring rules
to score a sequence of predictions that are targeting a single outcome.
These scoring rules discount predictions over time and appropriately
weight prediction updates.

## Real-Time Transit Network Modelling For Improved Arrival Time Predictions {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Tom Elliott and Thomas Lumley<br />
University of Auckland<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The growing availability of GPS tracking
devices means that public transport passengers can now check on the
real-time location of their bus from their mobile phone, helping them to
decide when to leave home, and once at the stop, how long until the bus
arrives. A side effect of this technology is that statistical models
using vehicle location data to predict arrival times have taken a “back
seat” in preference for methods that are simpler and faster, but less
robust. Auckland Transport, who operate our local public transport
network, demonstrate this: the estimated arrival time (ETA) of a bus at
a stop is simply the time until scheduled arrival, plus the delay at the
bus’ most recently visited stop. The most evident problem with this
approach is that intermediate stops, traffic lights, and road
congestion—all of which affect ETAs—are not considered. We have been
developing a modelling framework consisting of (1) a vehicle state model
to infer parameters, such as speed, from a sequence of GPS positions;
(2) a transit network model that uses information from the vehicle model
to estimate traffic conditions along roads in the network; and (3) a
predictive model combining vehicle and transit network states to predict
arrival times. Since multimodality is common—for example a bus may or
may not stop at a bus stop or traffic lights—we are using a particle
filter to estimate vehicle state, which makes no assumptions about the
shape of the distribution, and allows for a more intuitive likelihood
function. While this provides a very flexible framework, it is also a
computationally intensive one, so computational demands need to be
considered to ensure it will be viable as a real-time application for
providing passengers with improved, and hopefully reliable, arrival time
information.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Integrative analysis of high dimensional
omics datasets has been studied by many authors in recent years. By
incorporating prior known relationships among the variables, these
analyses have been successful in elucidating the relationships between
different sets of omics data. In this article, our goal is to identify
important relationships between genomic expression and cytokine data
from an HIV vaccination trial. We proposed a flexible Partial Least
Squares technique which incorporates group and subgroup structure in the
modelling process. Our new methodology expands on previous work, by
accounting for both grouping of genetic markers (e.g. genesets) and
temporal effects. The method generalises existing sparse modelling
techniques in the PLS methodology and establishes theoretical
connections to variable selection methods for supervised and
unsupervised problems. Simulation studies are performed to investigate
the performance of our methods over alternative sparse approaches. Our
method has been implemented in a comprehensive R package called sgsPLS.

## BIG-SIR A Sliced Inverse Regression Approach For Massive Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In a massive data setting, we focus on a
semiparametric regression model involving a real dependent variable $Y$
and a $p$-dimensional covariable $X$. This model includes a dimension
reduction of X via an index $X'\beta$. The Effective Dimension Reduction
(EDR) direction $\beta$ cannot be directly estimated by the Sliced
Inverse Regression (SIR) method due to the large volume of the data. To
deal with the main challenges of analysing massive datasets which are
the storage and computational efficiency, we propose a new SIR estimator
of the EDR direction by following the “divide and conquer” strategy. The
data is divided into subsets. EDR directions are estimated in each
subset which is a small dataset. The recombination step is based on the
optimisation of a criterion which assesses the proximity between the EDR
directions of each subset. Computations are run in parallel with no
communication among them. The consistency of our estimator is
established and its asymptotic distribution is given. Extensions to
multiple indices models, $q$-dimensional response variable and/or
SIR$_{\alpha}$-based methods are also discussed. A simulation study
using our `edrGraphicalTools` R package shows that our approach enables
us to reduce the computation time and conquer the memory constraint
problem posed by massive datasets. A combination of `foreach` and
`bigmemory` R packages are exploited to offer efficiency of execution in
both speed and memory. Results are visualised using the
bin-summarise-smooth approach through the `bigvis` R package. Finally,
we illustrate our proposed approach on a massive airline data set.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The importance of systems enabling us to
extract useful information from enormous text data produced every day
along with our social activities in organizations or on the internet and
utilize the information immediately and efficiently have been
increasing. In this research, an analyzing method which extracts
essential parts from a huge document set utilizing association rule
analysis as a data mining method is introduced. The method detects
typical combinations of terms involved in contexts and regards them as
the characterization of text data and it is also combined with
information retrieval methods for the sake of further selection as some
parts of the essential contexts. This method is considered to enhance
its ability of detection for particular contexts that contain some
topics and include moderately distributed terminologies. And
implementation of the system is discussed in order for utilizing the
abstracted documents efficiently as some sort of knowledge such as
collective intelligence. An approach for linkage with R is also
mentioned in the phase of the implementation of the model.

## Bayesian Survival Analysis Of Batsmen In Test Cricket {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> It is widely accepted that in the sport of
cricket, batting is more difficult early in a player’s innings, but
becomes easier as a player familiarizes themselves with the local
conditions. Here we develop a Bayesian survival analysis method to
predict and quantify the Test Match batting abilities for international
cricketers, at any stage of a player’s innings. The model is applied in
two stages, firstly to individual players, allowing us to quantify
players’ initial and equilibrium batting abilities, and the rate of
transition between the two. The results indicate that most players begin
a Test match innings batting with between a quarter and a half of their
potential batting ability. The model is then implemented using a
hierarchical structure, providing us with more general inference
concerning a selected group of opening batsmen from New Zealand. Using
this hierarchical structure we are able to make predictions for the
batting abilities of the next opening batsman to debut for New Zealand.
These results are considered in conjunction with other performance based
metrics, allowing us to identify players who excel in the role of
opening the batting, which has practical implications in terms of
batting order and team selection policy.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Distributed Computing Systems such as Hadoop
and Spark allow statistical analysis to be performed on arbitrary large
datasets. However, when performing statistical analysis on these
systems, the data communication between the nodes of a distributed
computing system can become a major performance bottleneck. In this
work, we outline a novel combination of statistical and computation
techniques to address this issue. We first apply data reduction
technique such as coarsening (interval-censoring) on large data sets
using a distributed computing system. We then perform statistical
analysis on the coarsened data. However, performing analysis using
coarsened data potentially introduces biases in the results. To address
this, we use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to recover the
complete (non-coarsened) data model. Our work draws on methods for the
analysis of data involving coarsened co-variates using EM by methods of
weights. We explore different coarsening strategies (e.g., rounding,
quantile and quintile) and discuss how our methods can scale to very
large data settings. Through simulation studies, we find our method
works especially well when data is coarsened from a wide interval, where
there are more loss of information. Compared with naïvely using the
coarsened data, our method is able to estimate regression coefficients
that are closer to estimates obtained from using the complete data. In
addition, the standard errors from our method reflect more accurately
the uncertainty arising from using coarsened data.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We have been annoyed by tons of unwilling
accesses in many Internet applications including SSH (Secure SHell)
known as a typical remote access tool and E-mail delivery protocols. An
attacked server put a report according to the configuration and the log
files have grown day by day.

Bad accesses might be caused by computer virus and so-called
<span>*zombie*</span>, a hi-jacked computer. We assume that the actions
would have their own trends. For example, we sometimes find that a few
attacks come simultaneously from only 1 site, however, we also find
several attacks from a set of the sites within 1 minute or 1 day. The
IP-Addresses might be variable, however, within the assigned range. It
suggests that the victimizer is just one but gets an IP-Address
allocation so many times.

To analyze the log files and give an interpretation to them, we
introduce Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) to adopt its main idea
<span>*concept*</span>. If we configure an appropriate
<span>*concept*</span> whose elements (<span> *individuals*</span> in
SDA) are IP-Address, port-numbers and attack time span, we can reveal
some relationship between <span>*concepts*</span> and classify them into
perspective. The results would give us some useful information to
protect our Internet environment.

We discuss how we get them and the interpretation appropriately through
some practical examples.

methodological approaches applied to tease out the various nuances of
developing such a clinical decision aid. By way of summary, a series of
logistic regression models were developed and refined to identify
predictors chronic postoperative pain, where pain was reported using the
numerical pain rating scale (NRS). Self-reported NRS pain was
dichotomized based on functional status using a defined statistical
approach. Multivariate models were developed using a stepwise selection
approach, accounting for interaction and collinearity. The effect of
changing collinearity thresholds on information criterion is
illustrated. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated, along with
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for each logistic
model. Final models were chosen by a combination of superior area under
the curve (AUC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The stability of
β coefficients across the top performing models is reported, along with
model goodness-of-fit using the Hosmer and Lameshow methodology.
Cut-point analyses are reported on models performances, including the
effect of changing pain thresholds on model accuracy. Finally, the
conversion of a superior logistic model into a probabilistic function,

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the introduction of R, research in Statistical Computing has
plateaued. Although R is, at best, a stop-gap system, there appears to
be very little active research on creating better computing
environments for Statistics.

When work on R commenced there were a multitude of software systems
for statistical data analysis in use and under development. There was
friendly competition and collaboration between developers. While R can
be seen as providing a useful unification for users, its success and
dominance can be viewed as now holding back research and the
development of new systems.

In this talk we'll examine what might be behind this and also look at
some research aimed at exploring some of the design space for new
systems. The aim is to show constructively that new work in the area
is still possible.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Using a unique database containing
information on the amount of R&D tax credits and regional, national and
European subsidies received by firms in French NUTS3 regions over the
period 2001-2011, we provide new evidence on the efficiency of R&D
policies taking into account spatial dependency across regions. By
estimating a spatial Durbin model with regimes and fixed effects, we
show that in a context of yardstick competition between regions,
national subsidies are the only instrument that displays total leverage
effect. For other instruments internal and external effects balance each
other resulting in insignificant total effects. Structural breaks
corresponding to tax credit reforms are also revealed.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Scientific collaborations are among the main
enablers of development in small national science systems. Although
analysing scientific collaborations is a well-established subject in
scientometrics, evaluations of collaborative activities of countries
remain speculative with studies based on a limited number of fields or
using data too inadequate to fully represent collaborations at a
national level. This study provides a unique view on the collaborative
aspect of scientific activities in New Zealand. We perform a
quantitative study based on all Scopus publications in all subjects for
over 1500 New Zealand institutions over a period of 6 years to generate
an extensive mapping of New Zealand scientific collaborations. The
comparative results reveal the levels of collaboration between New
Zealand institutions and business enterprises, government institutions,
higher education providers, and private not for profit organisations in
2010-2015. Constructing a collaboration network of institutions, we
observe a power-law distribution indicating that a small number of New
Zealand institutions account for a large proportion of national
collaborations. Network centrality measures are deployed to identify the
most influential institutions of the country in terms of scientific
collaboration. We also provide comparative results on 15 universities
and crown research institutes based on 27 subject classifications. This
study was based on Scopus custom data and supported by the Te Pūnaha
Matatini internship program at Ministry of Business, Innovation &
Employment.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this study we examine how family structure affects the academic
achievement of students at the secondary level of education age in
Tonga. It is a comparative study aiming to find out whether there is a
significant difference between the academic achievements of students
from a traditional family and those from a non-traditional family. We
define a Tongan traditional family as being two biological parents (or
adoptive parents from birth), one male and one female where as
non-traditional family can be a single parent family, or the student has
no parent present (for example they are staying with relatives or
friends). In our study we are looking at what are the key drivers of
success and trying to understand the relationship between academic
achievements and family structure. We hope the study will provide
evidence-based information to aid the administrators, other educators
and parents to adopt the best practices and actions for the students.
The target population for this study is the high school students age 13
to 18 in Tonga. The study is limited to the high schools in the main
island of Tonga- Tongatapu which has 12 high schools where two high
schools are government schools and the others are private schools run by
different religions. In April we surveyed 360 students, 60 from each of
6 high schools, and present here our preliminary results.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major
multifactorial condition that predisposes adults to type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. It is defined as having at least three of five
cardiometabolic risk components: 1) high fasting triglyceride level, 2)
low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 3) elevated fasting
plasma glucose, 4) large waist circumference (abdominal obesity) and 5)
hypertension. In the US Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation
(SWAN), a 15-year multi-centre prospective cohort study of women from
five racial/ethnic groups, the incidence of MetS increased as midlife
women underwent the menopausal transition (MT). A model is sought to
examine the interdependent progression of the five MetS components and
the influence of demographic covariates.

## Clustering Of Curves On A Spatial Domain Using A Bayesian Partitioning Model {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for
spatial clustering of the high-dimensional functional data based on the
effects of functional covariates. We couple the functional mixed-effects
model with a generalized spatial partitioning method for: (1)
identifying subregions for the high-dimensional spatio-functional data;
(2) improving the computational feasibility via parallel computing over
subregions or multi-level partitions; and (3) addressing the
near-boundary ambiguity in model-based spatial clustering techniques.
The proposed model extends the existing spatial clustering techniques to
produce spatially contiguous partitions for spatio-functional data. The
model successfully captured the regional effects of the atmospheric and
cloud properties on the spectral radiance measurements. This elaborates
the importance of considering spatially contiguous partitions for
identifying regional effects and small-scale variability.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In contrast to previous model dividing
necessity entrepreneurs as individuals facing push factors due to lack
of employment, we consider the possibility of push factors faced by
employed individuals (Folta et al. (2010)). The theoretical model yields
distinctive predictions relating occupation characteristics and the
probability of entry into entrepreneurship. Using PSED and ONET data, we
investigate how the characteristics of individuals? primary occupations
affect nascent entrepreneurs? effort put into venture creation. The
empirical evidences show that necessity entrepreneurs are not only
confined to unemployed individuals. We find compelling evidence that
individuals facing arduous working conditions (e.g. stressful
environment and physical tiredness) have a higher likelihood of entering
and succeeding in self-employment than others. Contrariwise, individuals
who experience high degree of self-realization, independence and
responsibility in the workplace are less committed to their business
than individuals exposed to arduous working conditions. These findings
have strong implication for how we interpret and analyze necessity
entrepreneurs and provide novel insights into the role of occupational
experience in the process of venture emergence.

## Statistical Models For The Source Attribution Of Zoonotic Diseases: A Study Of Campylobacteriosis {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Preventing and controlling zoonoses with a
public health policy depends on the knowledge scientists have about the
transmitted pathogens. Modelling jointly the epidemiological data and
genetic information provides a methodology for tracing back the source
of infection. However, this creates difficulties in assessing genetic
efforts behind models of the final statistical inferences due to
increased model complexity. To explore the genetic effects in the joint
model, we develop a genetic free model and compare it to the joint
model. We apply the two models to a recent campylobacteriosis study to
estimate the attribution probability for each source. A spatial
covariate is also considered in the models in order to investigate the
effect of the level of rurality on the source attributions. Comparing
the attributions generated by the two models, we find that: i) the
genetic information integrated in the joint model gives a little more
precise inference to the sparse cases observed in highly rural areas
than the genetic free model; ii) on the logit scale, source attribution
probabilities follow linear trends against level of rurality; and iii)
poultry is the dominant source of campylobacteriosis in urban centres,
whereas ruminants are the most attributable source when in rural areas.

## Latent Variable Models And Multivariate Binomial Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A large body of work has been devoted to
latent variable models applicable to multivariate binary data. However
little work has been put into extending these models to cases where the
observed data is multivariate binomial. In this paper, we will first
show that models that use either a logit or probit link function, offer
the same level of modelling flexibility in the binary case, but only the
logit link fits into a data augmentation approach that compactly extends
from binary to binomial. Secondly, we will demonstrate that multivariate
binomial data provides greater flexibility in how the link function can
be represented. Lastly, we will consider properties of the implied
distribution of latent probabilities under a logit link.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Estimating disease trajectories has
increasingly become more essential to clinical practitioners to
administer effective treatment to their patients. A part of describing
disease trajectories involves taking patients’ medical histories and
sociodemographic factors into account and grouping them into similar
groups, or clusters. Advances in computerised patient databases have
paved a way for identifying such trajectories in patients by recording a
patient’s medical history over a long period of time (longitudinal
data): we studied data from the PREDICT-CVD dataset, a national
primary-care cohort from which people with diabetes from 2002-2015 were
identified through routine clinical practice. We fitted a Bayesian
hierarchical linear model with latent clusters to the repeated
measurements of HbA$_1c$ and eGFR, using the Markov birth-death process
proposed by Stephens (2000) to handle the changes in dimensionality as
clusters were added or removed.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP)

estimating density functions of temporal data. In particular, we
introduce species sampling mixture models with temporal dependence. To
accommodate temporal dependence, we define dependent species sampling
models by modeling random support points and weights through an
autoregressive model, and then we construct the mixture models based on
the collection of these dependent species sampling models. We propose an
algorithm to generate posterior samples and present simulation studies
to compare the performance of the proposed models with competitors that
are based on Dirichlet process mixture models. We apply our method to
the estimation of densities for the price of apartment in Seoul, the
closing price in Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), and climate

a parallel coordinate plot, where the ordering, locations and scales of
each axis are simultaneously chosen so that all connecting lines, each

possible. The textile plot transforms a data matrix in order to
delineate a parallel coordinate plot. Using the geometric properties of
the textile set derived by Sei and Tanaka (2015), we show that the

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We consider estimation of intensity function
for spatial point processes based on area-aggregated data. A standard
approach for estimating the intensity function for a spatial point
pattern is to use a kernel estimator. However, when data are only
available in a spatially aggregated form with the numbers of events
available in geographical subregions, traditional methods developed for
individual-level event data become infeasible. In this research, a

## Bayesian Inference For Population Attributable Measures {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Sarah Pirikahu, Geoff Jones, Martin Hazelton, and Cord Heuer<br />
Massey University<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Epidemiologists often wish to determine the population impact of an
intervention to remove or reduce a risk factor. Population attributable
type measures, such as the population attributable risk (PAR) and
population attributable fraction (PAF), provide a means of assessing
this impact, in a way that is accessible for a non-statistical audience.
To apply these concepts to epidemiological data, the calculation of
estimates and confidence intervals for these measures should take into
account the study design (cross-sectional, case-control, survey) and any
sources of uncertainty (such as measurement error in exposure to the
risk factor). We provide methods to produce estimates and Bayesian
credible intervals for the PAR and PAF from common epidemiological study
types and assess the Frequentist properties. The model is then extended
by incorporating uncertainty due to the use of imperfect diagnostic
tests for disease or exposure. The resulting model can be
non-identifiable, causing convergence problems for common MCMC samplers,
such as Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings. An alternative importance
sampling method performs much better for these non-identifiable models
and can be used to explore the limiting posterior distribution. The data
used to estimate these population attributable measures may include
multiple risk factors in addition to the one being considered for
removal. Uncertainty regarding the distribution of these risk factors in
the population affects the inference for PAR and PAF. To allow for this
we propose a methodology involving the Bayesian bootstrap. We also
extend the analysis to allow for complex survey designs with unequal
weights, stratification and clustering.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> It is beneficial for modeling data of
interest to exploit secondary information. The secondary information is
called auxiliary variables, which may not be observed in testing data
because they are not of primary interest. In this paper, we incorporate
the auxiliary variables into a framework of supervised learning.
Furthermore, we consider a covariate shift situation that allows a
density function of covariates to change between testing and training
data. It is known that the Maximum Log-likelihood Estimate (MLE) is not
a good estimator under model misspecification and the covariate shift.
This problem can be resolved by the Maximum Weighted Log-likelihood
Estimate (MWLE).

When we have multiple candidate models, it needs to select the best
candidate model where its optimality is measured by the expected
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The Akaike information criterion (AIC)
is a well known criterion based on the KL divergence and using the MLE.
Therefore, its validity is not guaranteed when the MWLE is used under
the covariate shift. An information criterion under the covariate shift
was proposed in Shimodaira (2000, JSPI) but this criterion does not take
use of the auxiliary variables into account. Hence, we resolve this
problem by deriving a new criterion. In addition, simulations are
conducted to examine the improvement.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> This study investigated the outcomes of a brief telephone intervention

for 36 months. After giving consent, participants received a baseline
assessment followed by a manualised version of the helpline’s standard

months, 79Depression is found to often be associated with problem
gambling behaviour, and analysis was undertaken to examine the impact of
a brief telephone intervention for problem gambling on rates of
depression using logistic regression. At baseline depression was found
to be associated with gender, problem gambling risk (PGSI), and
deprivation (NZiDep). A multiple variable model found that PGSI and
mental health medication best explained depression at baseline. A
repeated measures logistic regression utilising all 36 months of data
found that PGSI, NZiDep, and mental health medication were the best
variables to explain the change over time. Conclusion was that the
intervention’s impact on problem gambling behaviour also changed
depression rates, however deprivation and mental health medication also
contributed.

function, and then a suitable prior distribution is chosen to allow
exact computation of the (approximate) marginal likelihood arising from
the Laplace approximation and the prior. The result is a closed-form
expression similar to BIC, but now involves a term arising from the
prior distribution (which BIC ignores) and also incorporates the idea
that different parameters can have different effective sample sizes
(whereas BIC only allows one overall sample size $n$). We also consider
a modification of PBIC which is more favorable to complex models.

making use of a developed renewal theory, we provide a closed form
approximation for the joint default probability, default correlation and
expected default time, both for a specific firm as well as the first to
default among a group of firms. Moreover, based on the approximated
default correlation and expected default time, we propose a multi-name
Distance-to-Default, which can be used to explain the feature of
corporate default clustering: contagion and co-movement. Numerical
studies for evaluating a multi-name Distance-to-Default are given to

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Spatio-temporal statistical datasets are
becoming widely available for social, ecomonic, and environmental
researches, however it is often difficult to summarize it and undermine
hidden spatial/temporal patterns due to its complexity. Geographically
weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA), which uses a moving
window or kernel and applies localized PCAs over geographical scape, may
be worth to do it, while to optimize kernel bandwidth size and to
determine the number of component to retain (NCR) were the most concern
(Tsutsumida et al (2017)). In this research we determine both of them
together simultaneously so as to minimize leave-one-out residual
coefficient of variation of GWPCA with changing bandwidth size and NCR.
As a case study we use annual goat population statistics across 341
administrative units in Mongolia in 1990-2012, and show spatiotemporal
variations in data, especially influenced by natural disasters.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In 2004, Aitken and Lucy published an article detailing a two-level
likelihood ratio for multivariate trace evidence. This model has been
adopted in a number of forensic disciplines such as the interpretation
of glass, drugs (MDMA), and ink. Modern instrumentation is capable of
measuring many elements in very low quantities and, not surprisingly,
forensic scientists wish to exploit the potential of this extra
information to increase the weight of this evidence. The issue, from a
statistical point of view, is that the increase in the number of
variables (dimension) in the problem leads to increased data demand to
understand both the variability within a source, and in between sources.
Such information will come in time, but usually we don’t have enough.
One solution to this problem is to attempt to reduce the dimensionality
through methods such as principal component analysis. This practice is
quite common in high dimensional machine learning problems. In this
talk, I will describe a study where we attempt to quantify the effects
of this this approach on the resulting likelihood ratios using data
obtained from SEM-EDX instrument.

## An EWMA Chart For Monitoring Covariance Matrix Based On Dissimilarity Index {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk, we propose an EWMA chart for
monitoring covariance matrix based on the dissimilarity index of two
matrices. It is different from the conventional EWMA charts for
monitoring covariance matrix which are either based on comparing the sum
or product or both of the eigenvalues of the estimated EWMA covariance
matrix with those of the IC covariance matrix. The proposed chart
essentially monitors covariance matrix by comparing the individual
eigenvalues of the estimated EWMA covariance matrix with those of the
estimated covariance matrix from the IC phase I data. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed chart by comparing it with the best existing
chart under the multivariate normal process. Furthermore, to prevent the
control limit of the proposed EMMA chart using the limited IC phase I
data from having extensively excessive false alarms, we use a bootstrap
method to adjust the control limit to guarantee that the proposed chart
has the actual IC average run length not less than the nominal one with
a certain probability. Finally, we use an example to demonstrate the
applicability and implementation of the proposed chart.

## Adjusting For Linkage Bias In The Analysis Of Record-Linked Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Patrick Graham<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Data formed from record-linkage of two or
more datasets are an increasingly important source of data for public
health and social science research. For example, a study cohort may be
linked to administrative data in order to add outcome or covariate
information to data collected directly from study participants. However,
regardless of the linkage method, it is often the case that not all
records are linked. Further, linkage rates usually vary with
characteristics of analytical interest and this differential linkage can
bias analyses restricted just to linked records. While linked records
have full outcome and covariate information, unlinked records exhibit
“block-missingness” whereby the values for the entire block of variables
contained in the file that is linked to are missing for unlinked
records. Similar missing data structures occur in other contexts,
including panel studies when participants decline participation in one
or more study waves. In this paper, I consider the problem of adjusting
for linkage bias from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives. A
basic distinction is whether analysis is based on all available data or
just the linked cases. The Bayesian perspective leads to the former
option and to Gibbs sampling and multiple imputation as reasonable
methods. Basing analysis only on the linked cases seems to require a
frequentist perspective and leads to inverse probability of linkage
weighting and conditional maximum likelihood as reasonable approaches.
The implications of the assumption of ignorable linkage also differ
somewhat between the approaches. A simulation investigation confirms
that, assuming ignorable linkage given observed data, multiple
imputation, conditional maximum likelihood and inverse probability of
linkage weighting all succeed in adjusting for linkage bias and achieve
nominal interval coverage rates. Conditional maximum likelihood is
slightly more efficient than inverse probability of linkage weighting
and that multiple imputation can be more efficient than conditional
maximum likelihood. Extensions to the case of non-ignorable linkage are
also considered.

## Bayesian Semiparametric Hierarchical Models For Longitudinal Data Analysis With Application To Dose-Response Studies {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this work, we propose semiparametric
Bayesian hierarchical additive mixed effects models for analyzing either
longitudinal data or clustered data with applications to dose-response
studies. In the semiparametric mixed effects model structure, we
estimate nonparametric smoothing functions of continuous covariates by
using a spectral representation of Gaussian processes and the
subject-specific random effects by using Dirichlet process mixtures. In
this framework, we develop semiparametric mixed effects models that
include normal regression and quantile regressions with or without shape
restrictions. In addition, we deal with the Bayesian nonparametric
measurement error models, or errors-in-variable regression models, using
Fourier series and Dirchlet process mixtures, in which the true
covariate is not observable, but the surrogate of the true covariate, is
only observed. The proposed methodology is compared with other existing
approaches to additive mixed models in simulation studies and benchmark
data examples. More importantly, we consider a real data application for
dose-response analysis, in which measurement errors and shape
constraints in the regression functions need to be incorporated with
inter-study variability.

## Optimizing Junior Rugby Weight Limits {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The New Zealand rugby community is aware of safety issues within the
junior game and has applied weight limits for each tackle grade to
minimize injury risk. However, for heavier children this can create an
uncomfortable situation as they may no longer be playing with their peer
group. The study evaluated almost 13,000 observations from junior rugby
players across three seasons (2015-2017) using data supplied by
Wellington Rugby. To protect privacy, the data was structured so that an
individual could not be readily identified but could be tracked across
seasons to determine churn. As data for several consecutive seasons was
available, we could determine the likelihood of a junior player
returning the following season and isolate the drivers of this
behaviour. Applying a logistic regression and repeated measures analysis
the study determined if children who are over the specified weight limit
for their age group are more likely to leave the game. Furthermore,
assuming the importance of playing with peers, the study identified the
impact of age in relation to the date-of-birth cut-off of January 1st.
This is of interest given that a child playing above their age-weight
grade could be competing against individuals three school years above
them. The study primarily focuses on determining the optimal age-weight
bands while the secondary focus is on determining the likelihood of a
junior Wellington rugby player returning the following season and
isolating the drivers of this behaviour.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Spatial scan statistics are widely used for
cluster detection analysis in geographical disease surveillance. While
the method has been developed for various types of data such as binary,
count and continuous data, spatial scan statistics for matched
case-control data, which often arise in spatial epidemiology, have not
been considered yet. In this paper, we propose two spatial scan
statistics for matched case-control data. The proposed test statistics
properly consider the correlations between matched pairs. We evaluate
statistical power and cluster detection accuracy of the proposed methods
through simulations comparing with the Bernoulli-based method. We
illustrate the methods with the use of a real data example.

## Whitebait In All Its Varieties: One Fish, Two Fish, Three, Four, Five Fish. {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Bridget Armstrong<br />
University of Canterbury<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> There are five species of fishes of the genus Galaxias that make up whitebait catches in New Zealand, although one species (G. maculatus) makes up &gt;90% of the catch. Whitebait are immature post-larval fish that have yet to develop the distinctive morphological traits of adults. However, in their tiny stages as whitebait the five species are difficult to tell apart. There are also distinct spatial (rivers) and temporal (different months in the whitebait fishing season) differences among the species and even within species. To manage the fishery better it is necessary to identify regional differences in the species composition of catches, which is difficult because of the time and effort required to sample catches and identify species morphologically or genetically. In my study, I will use a recently compiled database comprising 17,000 entries of whitebait samples, species composition, and variability to develop a statistical model to predict the likelihood of species-to-species composition of catches throughout New Zealand. This probabilistic model could potentially be a powerful tool in the fishery and conservation of whitebait species, some of which are considered to be threatened.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Including questions about sexual health in the annual Health Survey for
England (HSE) provides opportunities for regular measurement of key
public health indicators, augmenting Britain’s decennial National Survey
of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). However, contextual and
methodological differences may limit comparability of the findings. For
instance both surveys used self-completion for administering sexual
behaviour questions but this was via computer-assisted self-interview
(CASI) in Natsal-3 and a pen-and-paper questionnaire in HSE 2010. We
examine the extent of these differences between HSE 2010 and Natsal-3
(undertaken 2010-2012) and investigate their impact on parameter
estimates. For inclusion to this study, we restricted participants to
men and women in the 2010 HSE (n = 2,782 men and 3,588 women) and
Natsal-3 (n = 4,882 men and 6,869 women) aged 16-69 years and resident
in England. We compared their demographic characteristics, the amount of
non-response to, and estimates from, sexual health questions. We used
complex survey analysis to take into account stratification, clustering,
and weighting of the data in each survey. Logistic regression was used
to measure the extent to which sexual health estimates differ in HSE
2010 relative to Natsal-3, with multivariable models to adjust for
significant demographic confounders. Additionally, investigated
age-group interactions to see if differences between the surveys varied
by age. The surveys achieved similar response rates, both around 60While
a relatively high response to sexual health questions in HSE 2010
demonstrates the feasibility of asking such questions in a general
health survey, differences with Natsal-3 do exist. These are likely due
to the HSE’s context as a general health survey and methodological
limitations such as its current use of pen-and-paper questionnaires.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Building a predictive model of crime with
good predictive accuracy has a great value in enabling efficient use of
policing resources and reduction in crime. Building such models is not
straightforward though due to the dynamic nature of the crime process.
The crime not only evolves over both space and time, but is also related
to several complex socio-economic factors, not all of which can be
measured directly and accurately. The last decade or more has seen a
surge in the effort to model crime more accurately. Many of the models
developed so far have failed to capture the crime with a great degree of
accuracy. The main reasons could be that all these models discretise the
space using grid cells and that they are spatial, not spatio-temporal.
We fit a log Gaussian Cox process model using the INLA-SPDE approach.
This not only allows us to capture crime as a process continuous in both
space and time, but also allows us to include socio-economic factors as
well as the ’near repeat’ phenomenon. In this talk, we will discuss the
model building process and the accuracy achieved.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Especially in the automotive industry, semiconductor devices are key components for the proper functioning of the entire vehicle. Therefore, issues concerning the reliability of these components are of crucial
importance to manufacturers of semiconductor devices.

In this quality control task, we consider longitudinal data from high
temperature operating life tests. Manufacturers then need to find
appropriate tolerance limits for their final electrical product tests,
such that the proper functioning of their devices is ensured. Based on
these datasets, we compute tolerance limits that could then be used by
automated test equipment for the ongoing quality control process.
Devices with electrical parameters within their respective tolerance
limits can successfully finish the production line, while all other
devices will be discarded. In calculating these tolerance limits, our
approach consists of two steps: First, the observed measurements are
transformed in order to capture measurement biases and gauge
repeatability and reproducibility. Then, in the second step, we compute
tolerance limits based on a multivariate copula model with skew normal
distributed margins. In order to solve the resulting optimization
problem, we propose a new derivative-free optimization procedure.

The capability of the model is demonstrated by computing optimal
tolerance limits for several drift patterns that are expected to cover a
wide range of scenarios. Based on these computations, we show the
resulting yield losses and analyze the performance of the tolerance
limits a large simulation study.

## Model-Checking For Regressions: A Local Smoothing-Based Global Smoothing Test {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> As the two kinds of methods for model
specification problem, local smoothing tests and global smoothing tests
exhibit different characteristics. Compared with global smoothing tests,
local smoothing tests can only detect local alternatives distinct from
the null hypothesis at a much slower rate when the dimension of
predictor vector is high, but can be more sensitive to high-frequency
alternatives. We suggest a projection-based test that builds a bridge
between the local and global smoothing methodologies to benefit from
their own advantages. The test construction is based on a kernel
estimation-based local smoothing method and the resulting test becomes a
distance-based global smoothing test. A closed-form expression of the
test statistic is derived and the asymptotic properties are
investigated. Simulations and a real data analysis are conducted to
evaluate the performance of the test in finite sample cases.

## Breeding Value Estimation In Partially-Genotyped Populations {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Alastair Lamont<br />
University of Otago<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In livestock, a primary goal is the identification of individuals’
breeding values - a measure of their genetic worth. This identification
can be used to aid with selective breeding, but is non trivial due to
how large data can be.

Measured traits are typically modelled as being caused by both breeding
values and also environmental fixed effects. An efficient method for
fitting this model was developed by Henderson (1984), based upon
generalized least squares. This method could be applied to data where
the pedigree - how each animal was related to one another - was fully
known.

Improvements in technology have allowed the genetic information of an
animal to be directly measured. These measurements can be taken very
early in life, with the goal of informing selective breeding faster and
more efficiently. Meuwissen (2001) adapted the standard model to
incorporate genetic data, and additionally developed multiple fitting
methods for this model.

Modern datasets are frequently only partially genotyped. The methods of
Meuwissen cannot be used for these data, as they are only applicable to
populations in which every individual is gentoyped. Modern fitting
approaches aim to make use of the available genetic information without
requiring all individuals be genotyped.

These approaches tend to either impute or average over missing genotype
data, which can affect the overall accuracy of breeding value
estimation. We are developing an alternative which instead incorporates
missing data within the model, rather than having to adapt fitting
approaches to accommodate it.

Preliminary results suggest that approaching fitting is this way can
lead to improved accuracy of estimation in certain situations.

for linear regression under the Bayesian framework. This model assumes
that each variable is assigned to a pre-specified group where only a
subset of the groups truly contribute to the response variable. Besides,
within the active groups, there are only a small number of variables are
important. A hierarchical formulation is adopted to mimic this pattern,
where the spike-slab prior is put on both individual variable level and
group level. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed using
variational inference. Both simulation studies and real examples are
analyzed, through which we illustrate the advantages of our method for
both variable selection and parameter estimation under certain
conditions.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A personalized medicine have been improved
through the statistic analysis of Big data such as registry data. In
these researches, subgroup identification analysis have been focused on.
The purpose of the analysis is detecting subgroup such that the efficacy
of the medical treatment is effective based on predictive factors for
the treatment.

Foster et al., (2011) proposed the subgroup identification method based
on two stage approach, called Virtual Twins (VT) method. In the first
stage of VT, the difference of treatment effect between treatment group
and control group is estimated by Random Forest. In the second stage,
responders are identified by using CART, where the estimated these
differences are set as the predictor variables.

However, the prediction accuracy of RandomForest tends to be lower than
that of Boosting. Therefore, generalized boosted model (Ridgeway, 2006)
is adopted in the first step. In addition to that, the number of rules
tend to be large in the second step when CART is used. In this paper, we
adopt a priori algorithm as the same way of SIDES(Lipkovich et al.,
2011).

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this work we consider a two-parameter distribution with bathtub shape
under progressive first failure censoring. We obtain maximum likelihood
estimates of unknown parameters and then compute observed Fisher
information matrix. Further we consider a non linear regression model to
estimate the unknown parameters using least square estimation method and
construct 95% Bonferroni confidence intervals for the same. We also
estimate the parameters using Bayesian approaches such as Tierney-Kadane
method and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm against gamma prior
distributions. One- and two-sample prediction problems are discussed
under Bayesian framework. We study the performance of proposed methods
using Monte Carlo Simulations and finally analyze a real data set for
illustration purposes.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Inverse regression is an appearing dimension
reduction method for regression models with multivariate covariates.
Recently, it has been extended to the cases with functional or
longitudinal covariates. However, the extensions focus on one
functional/longitudinal covariate only. In this work, we extend
functional inverse regression to the cases with multivariate functional
covariates. The asymptotical properties of the proposed estimators are
investigated. Simulation studies and data analysis are also provided to
demonstrate the performance of our method.

## Including Covariate Estimation Error When Predicting Species Distributions: A Simulation Exercise Using Template Model Builder {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Andrea Havron and Russell Millar<br />
University of Auckland<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Ecological managers often require knowledge
about species distributions across a spatial region in order to
facilitate best management practices. Statistical models are frequently
used to infer relationships between species observations (eg. presence,
abundance, biomass, etc.) and environmental covariates in order to
predict values at unobserved locations. Issues remain for situations
where covariate information is not available for a predictive location.
In these cases, spatial maps of covariates are often generated using
tools such as kriging; however, the uncertainties from this statistical
estimation are not carried through to the final species distribution
map. New advances in spatial modelling using the automated
differentiation software, Template Model Builder, allow both the spatial
process of the environmental covariates and the observations to be
modelled simultaneously by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the
fixed effects with a Laplace approximation after integrating out the
random spatial effects. This method allows for the uncertainty of the
covariate estimation process to be included in the standard errors of
final predictions as well as any derived quantities, such as total
biomass for a spatial region. We intend to demonstrate this method and
compare our predictions to those from a model where regional covariate
information is supplied from a kriging model.

## Factors Influencing On Growth Of Garments Industry In Bangladesh {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Md. Shahidul Islam and Mohammad Sazzad Mosharrof<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> If globalization provides the backdrop for drama, then the
achievements of the garment industry in Bangladesh are indeed dramatic.
The garment industry particularly has played a pioneering role in the
development of industrial sector of Bangladesh and has grown rapidly for
the last 15 years and now one of the largest garment exporters in the
world. The study of our research has examined the successful development
process of the Bangladesh garments industry and explored the keys to its
success. In point of view we collected some primary and secondary data
of garment manufacturers and traders to investigate further the key role
and mechanism of technology transfers to operate a garment industry in
Bangladesh. After that we apply some statistical models such as random
effect model, tobit model and probit model to generate the performance
of our variables. Also we use some dummy variables in case of different
years for all the models. The result of our statistical models indicate
that the high education of manufacturers and enterprise performance are
highly significant. The only reason of this close relationship is that
manufacturers have to upgrade their skills and they know how
continuously in order to survive the intense competition in the world
garment market and the high levels of the general human capital of the
entrepreneur are needed to manage an increasing number of managers and
experts. The result also shows the formal training that the garment
entrepreneur has received in a foreign country and the entrepreneur’s
experience of working at a garments enterprise have small effect on
growth of garment industry but not so much high. This is because those
garment workers who had acquired skills and know-how but they could not
helped smoothly new manufacturers and afford to start trading houses
without good marketing and communication skills. But the traders who
received formal training abroad have provided higher-valued services for
manufacturers and contributed more to the proliferation of
manufacturers. We have also found that foreign owned trading houses
perform better than indigenous trading houses, which suggests that there
still exist skills and know-how to be learned from foreign countries. So
technology transfer seems to be a long-term process and its effect also
seems last over the long term. Finally the key point of our findings
strongly suggest that the performance of manufacturers and traders as
well as production technologies are very potential for the high growth
of industrial development. It has a great opportunity to earn a lot of
foreign currency through developing garment industry and contribute
economic development.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In confirmatory clinical trials, the efficacy of a test treatment are
sometimes assessed by using multiple primary endpoints. We consider a
trial in which the efficacy of a test treatment is confirmed only when
it is superior to control for at least one of the endpoints and not
clinically inferior for the remaining endpoints. Nakazuru et al. (2014)
proposed a testing procedure that is applicable to the above case when
endpoints are continuous variables. In this presentation, firstly, we
propose a testing procedure in the case that all of the endpoints are
binary.

Westfall and Troendle (2008) proposed multivariate permutation tests.
Using this methods, we also propose an exact multiple testing procedure.

Finally, we compare an exact and approximate testing procedures proposed
above. The performance of the proposed procedures was examined through
Monte Carlo simulations.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> This work considers determination of optimum
warranty length under Type-II unified hybrid censoring scheme. Consumers
are willing to purchase a highly reliable product with certain cost
constraint. To assure the product reliability and also to remain
profitable, the manufacturer provides warranties on product lifetime.
Moreover, censoredlifetime data are available in practice, to assess the
reliability of the product. Therefore, determination of an appropriate
warranty length based on censored lifetime data is an important issue to
the manufacturer. It is assumed that the lifetime follows a lognormal
distribution. We consider a combine free replacement and pro-rata
warranty policy (FRW/PRW). The life test is conducted under Type-II
unified hybrid censoring scheme. The warranty length is obtained by
maximizing an expected utility function.The expectation is taken with
respect to the posterior predictive model for time to failure given the
available data obtained under Type-II unified hybrid censoring scheme. A
real data set is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methodology. We
propose a non-linear prorate warranty policy and compare them with
linear warranty policy. It is observed that non-linear prorate warranty
policy give larger warranty length with maximum profit

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We suggest a direct approach to estimate the coefficient functions for

depend on basis representations or dimension reductions. It can
accommodate for multiple functional responses and multiple functional

## Modelling The Distribution Of Lifetime Using Compound Time-Homogenous Poisson Process {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Kien Tran<br />
Victoria University of Wellington<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Modelling the distribution of lifetime has traditionally been done by
constructing a deterministic function for the survival function and/or
force of mortality. This paper outlines previous research and presents
the author’s initial attempts to model the force of mortality and
remaining lifetime using time-homogenous compound Poisson processes.

The paper presents two models. In model 1, the force of mortality of an
individual is modelled as a random sum of i.i.d random variables (i.e. a
compound Poisson process). In model 2, each individual is assumed to
have an initial normally distributed innate lifetime, and their
remaining life is a shifted compound Poisson process. In other words, we
assume that there are random events coming at a constant rate modifying
either the force of mortality or remaining lifetime of individuals.
Simulations in R are then run to find the optimized parameters and the
empirical survival function, force of mortality and distribution of
lifetime are then constructed. Finally, these outputs are compared
existing models and actual demographic data.

It turns out that for model 1, it is very difficult to model the force
of mortality using a time-homogenous compound Poisson process without
introducing additional complications such as the inclusion of event
times. For model 2, however, if we allow the events to be a Cauchy
random variable, then we can model the survival function of New Zealand
population much better than several existing well-known specifications
such as Weibull.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We address the statistical problem of
detecting change-points in the stress-strength reliability $R=P(X<Y)$ in
a sequence of paired variables $(X,Y)$. Without specifying their
underlying distributions, we embed this non-parametric problem into a
parametric framework and apply the maximum likelihood method via a
dynamic programming approach to determine the locations of the
change-points in R. Under some mild conditions, we show the consistency
and asymptotic properties of the procedure to locate the change-points.
Simulation experiments reveal that in comparison with existing
parametric and non-parametric change-point detection methods, our
proposed method performs well in detecting both single and multiple
change-points in R in terms of the accuracy of the location estimation
and the computation time. It offers robust and effective detection
capability without the need to specify the exact underling distribution
of the variables. Applications to real data demonstrate the usefulness
of our proposed methodology for detecting the change-points in the
stress-strength reliability R.

## New Zealand Crime And Victims Survey: Filling The Knowledge Gap {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Andrew Butcher and Michael Slyuzberg<br />
NZ Ministry of Justice<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The key objective of the Ministry of Justice is to ensure that New
Zealand has a strong justice system that contributes to a safe and just
society. To achieve this objective, the ministry and the wider Justice
Sector need to know whether they are focusing their efforts in the right
places and really making a difference. It is often difficult because we
lack a crucial piece of information: how much crime is actually out
there. Administrative data does not provide an answer as only about 30
The New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey (NZCVS) is introduced to fill
this knowledge gap. The survey which is currently on the pilot phase was
designed to meet the recommendations of Statistics New Zealand and key
stakeholders' demand. It will interview about 8,000 of New Zealand
residents aged from 15 years old and aims to: provide information
about the extent (volumes and prevalence) and nature of crime and
victimisation in New Zealand; provide geographical break-down of
victimisation; provide extensive victims' demographics; measure how
much crime gets reported to Police; understand the experiences of
victims; measure crime trends in New Zealand.

The paper summarises the core requirements to NZCVS obtained from
extended discussions with key stakeholders and describes key design
features to be implemented in order to meet these requirements. These
key requirements include, but are not limited to: Measuring the
extent and nature of reported and unreported crime across New Zealand;
Providing in-depth story-telling of victims' experiences; Providing
frequent and timely information to support Investment Approach for
Justice and wider decision making; Reducing information gaps by
matching the NZCVS with administrative data in Statistics New Zealand's
Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).

In particular, the paper discusses modular survey design which includes
core crime and victimisation questions and revolving modules added
annually, stratified random sampling, a new highly automated approach to
offence coding through extended screening, measuring harm from being
victimised, obtaining respondents' informed consent for data matching,
use of survey data for extended analysis and forecasting and other
important survey features.

## Missing Data In Randomised Control Trials: Stepped Multiple Imputation {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Rose Sisk and Alain Vandal<br />
Auckland University of Technology<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Missing data in Randomised Control Trials is usually
unavoidable, but can present considerable issues to analysis in an
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) setting. Multiple imputation is often regarded
as the most appropriate method of handling missing data when compared
with simpler methods such as complete case analysis and mean/mode
imputation. However, in practice it can often be tricky to implement
when working with large longitudinal datasets. The Sodium Lowering in
Dialysate (SOLID) trial is a randomised control trial seeking to improve
cardiovascular and other outcomes by lowering the dialysate
concentration of sodium of patients on home haemodialysis. The trial
contains 99 participants and over 30 primary and secondary outcomes.
Missing data from various sources are present at baseline and at
follow-up time points. Attempting to multiply impute a large number of
outcomes, each measured at up to 4 follow-up times, proved to be a
challenging task in this study. Several attempts to obtain sensible
imputations were made but many of these failed due to the presence of
highly correlated outcomes which were often missing together. This
presentation discusses the approach taken to overcome this problem,
which involved defining sets of outcomes to impute in various rounds,
preventing sets of similar (highly correlated, missing together)
outcomes being imputed in the same round. Once a round of imputation was
completed, the next set of outcomes to be imputed was matched onto the
completed dataset. This process is repeated until the full ITT dataset
contains no missing values in any outcomes. We call this “stepped
imputation”. Theory from mixed models was also applied to seek measures
associated with the missingness mechanism, with the potential to include
them in the final model to further reduce any possible bias resulting
from missing data. Results from a simulation to test the validity of
“stepped imputation” will be presented. In this simulation, an attempt
is made to generate data related in a similar way to the outcomes in the
SOLID trial. Results from the “gold standard” analysis with no missing
data, and the complete case analysis is compared to the stepped
imputation method.

## Online Learning For Bayesian Nonparametrics: Weakly Conjugate Approximation {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a new online learning method for
Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models so called <span>*weakly conjugate
approximation*</span> (WCA). We consider classes of BNP priors which are
weakly conjugate. Here, ‘weakly conjugate prior’ means that the
resulting posterior can be easily approximated by an efficient MCMC
algorithm.

Suppose the whole data set is divided into two groups, say
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{old},{{\bf x}}^{new}).$ Then, the Bayes rule
implies
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}) \propto p({{\bf x}}^{new}|\theta) p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}),$
where $\theta$ is the parameter. WCA replaces
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})$ with $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$ where the proxy
parameter $\eta$ is estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence
${\mathbb{E}}_{p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})}\left\{ \log p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)\right\}.$
It can be easily approximated when we can generate samples from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ To be more specific, suppose
$\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_M$ are samples generated from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ Then, we can estimate $\eta$ by minimizing
$\sum_{j=1}^M\left\{ \log p(\theta_j|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta_j|\eta)\right\}/M.$

To apply WCA for online learning with multiple batches, suppose the
whole data ${{\bf x}}$ are divided into multiple small batches as
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[S]}).$ A WCA algorithm
sequentially approximates
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[s]})$ by
$p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_s),$ where $\eta_s$ is the proxy parameter
minimizing the approximated KL divergence. Since $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$
is weakly conjugate, we can easily generate samples from
$p({{\bf x}}^{[s]}|\theta)p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_{s-1}),$ and hence easily
update $\eta_s.$

We compare several online learning algorithms by analyzing
simulated/real data sets in Dirichlet process mixture models and
hierarchical Dirichlet processes topic models. The proposed method shows
better accuracy in our experiments.

will outline the development of internal RStudio and Shiny servers at
Stats NZ, and give examples demonstrating the types of innovation
RStudio has enabled at Stats NZ to improve the way we produce and
disseminate statistics.

## Sparse Common Component Analysis {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Common component analysis (CCA) was proposed
by generalizing techniques for principal component analysis (PCA) for a
common basic structure identification (Wang et al., 2011). Although CCA
can identify the common structure of multiple datasets, which cannot be
extracted by standard PCA, the common components by CCA are estimated as
linear combinations of all variables, and thus it is difficult to
interpret the identified common components. Furthermore, the CCA
procedure may be disturbed by noisy features, because CCA is based on
the fully dense loadings. To address these issues, we proposed sparse
common component analysis based on $L_{1}$-type regularized regression
modeling. The proposed CCA can be performed by iterative sparse
non-centered PCA for a square root of a gram matrix. We also propose an
algorithm to estimate sparse common loadings of multiple datasets in
line with the algorithm of CCA. We observe from the numerical studies
that the proposed CCA can incorporate sparsity into the common loading
estimation, and recover a sparse common structure efficiently in
multiple dataset analysis.

## Random Search Global Optimization Using Random Forests {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Blair Robertson, Chris Price, and Marco Reale<br />
University of Canterbury<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The purpose of a global optimization
algorithm is to efficiently find an objective function’s global minimum.
In this talk we consider bound constrained global optimization, where
the search is performed in a box, denoted $\Omega$. The global
optimization problem is deceptively simple and it is usually difficult
to find the global minimum. One of the difficulties is that there is
often no way to verify that a local minimum is indeed the global
minimum. If the objective function is convex, the local minimum is also
the global minimum. However, many optimization problems are not convex.
Of particular interest in this talk are objective functions that lack
any special properties such as continuity, smoothness, or a Lipschitz
constant.

A random search algorithm for bound constrained global optimization is
presented. This algorithm alternates between partition and sampling
phases. At each iteration, points sampled from $\Omega$ are classified
low or high based on their objective function values. These classified
points define training data that is used to partition $\Omega$ into low
and high regions using a random forest. The objective function is then
evaluated at a number of points drawn from the low region and from
$\Omega$ itself. Drawing points from the low region focuses the search
in areas where the objective function is known to be low. Sampling
$\Omega$ reduces the risk of missing the global minimum and is necessary
to establish convergence. The new points are then added to the existing
training data and the method repeats.

A preliminary simulation study showed that alternating between random
forest partition and sampling phases was an effective strategy for
solving a variety of global optimization test problems. The authors are
currently refining the method and extending the set of test problems.

its focus on generating structured and labelled SVG output. The reason
for that was to maximise support for customisation and reuse,

were two major problems: killer examples of customisation and reuse
failed to materialise; and the production of SVG with
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was painfully slow. In brief,
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was a (sluggish) solution waiting

## Probabilistic Outlier Detection And Visualization Of Smart Meter Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Rob Hyndman<br />
Monash University<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> It is always a good idea to plot your data before fitting any models,
making any predictions, or drawing any conclusions. But how do you
actually plot data on thousands of smart meters, each comprising
thousands of observations over time? We cannot simply produce time plots
of the demand recorded at each meter, due to the sheer volume of data
involved.

I will propose an approach in which each long series of demand data is
converted to a single two-dimensional point that can be plotted in a
simple scatterplot. In that way, all the meters can be seen in the
scatterplot; so outliers can be detected, clustering can be observed,
and any other interesting structure can be examined. To illustrate, I
will use data collected during a smart metering trial conducted by the
Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in Ireland.

First we estimate the demand percentiles for each half hour of the week,
giving us 336 probability distributions per household. Then, we compute
the distances between pairs of households using the sum of
Jensen–Shannon distances.

From these pairwise distances, we can compute a measure of the
“typicality” of a specific household, by seeing how many similar houses
are nearby. If there are many households with similar probability
distributions, the typicality measure will be high. But if there are few
similar households, the typicality measure will be low. This gives us a
way of finding anomalies in the data set — they are the smart meters
corresponding to the least typical households.

The pairwise distances between households can also be used to create a
plot of all households together. Each of the household distributions can
be thought of as a vector in $K$-dimensional space where
$K=7\times48\times99 = 33,264$. To easily visualize these, we need to
project them onto a two-dimensional space. I propose using Laplacian
eigenmaps which attempt to preserve the smallest distances — so the most
similar points in $K$-dimensional space are as close as possible in the
two-dimensional space.

This way of plotting the data easily allows us to see the anomalies, to
identify any clusters of observations in the data, and to examine any
other structure that might exist.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The joint models for longitudinal data and
time-to-event data have been introduced to measure the association
between longitudinal data and survival time in clinical, epidemiological
and educational studies.. The main aim of this talk is to estimate the
parameters in the joint models using a Bayesian approach for nonlinear
longitudinal data and time-to-event data using penalized splines. To
perform this analysis, the joint posterior distribution of hazard rate
at baseline, survival and longitudinal coefficient and random effects
parameters is first being introduced followed by derivation of the
conditional posterior distributions for each of parameter. Based on
these target posterior distributions, the samples of parameters are
simulated using Metropolis, Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampler
algorithms. An R program is written to implement the analysis. Finally,
the prior sensitivity analysis for the baseline hazard rate and
association parameters is performed following by simulations studies and
a case study.

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This presentation is focused on how R is used
in Romanian official statistics to improve the quality of results
provided by different statistical data sources on the base of
administrative data. Some benefits for statistical analysis come when it
is possible to link administrative records from different registers
together, or when they can be linked with censuses or sample surveys.
Many of these record linkage or matching methods must be done under
statistically conditions, R program being one of the most powerful
analysis tool. In Romania, there has been increasing attention in recent
years to use R in official statistics, through specialized R courses for
statisticians and training on the job sessions. A international
conference on R (uRos) is yearly organized to provide a public forum for
researchers from academia and institutes of statistics. It is also a
continuous work to develop statistics based on Big Data, Romania being
part of the ESSnet Big Data Project.

## A Max-Type Multivariate Two-Sample Baumgartner Statistic {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A multivariate two-sample testing problem is
one of the most important topics in nonparametric statistics. Further, a
max-type Baumgartner statistic based on the modified Baumgartner
statistic (Murakami, 2006) was proposed by Murakami (2012) for testing
the equality of two continuous distribution functions. In this paper, a
max-type multivariate two-sample Baumgartner statistic is suggested
based on the Jurečková and Kalina’s ranks of distances (Jurečková and
Kalina, 2012). Simulations are used to investigate the power of the
suggested statistic for various population distributions. The results
indicate that the proposed test statistic is more suitable than various
existing statistics for testing a shift in the location, scale and
location-scale parameters.

## Dimension Reduction For Classification Of High-Dimensional Data By Stepwise SVM {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The purpose of this study is to build a
simple and intuitive wrapper method, stepwise SVM, for reducing
dimension and classification of large p small n datasets. The method
employs a suboptimum search procedure to determine the best subset of
variables for classification. The proposed method is compared with other
dimension reduction methods, such as Pearson product moment correlation
coefficient (PCCs), Recursive Feature Elimination based on Random Forest
(RF-RFE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using five gene
expression datasets. In this study, we show that stepwise SVM can
effectively select the important variables and perform well in
prediction. Moreover, the predictions of reduced datasets from stepwise
SVM are better than that of the unreduced datasets. Compared with other
methods, the performance of stepwise SVM is more stable than PCA and
RF-RFE but it is difficult to tell the difference in performance from
PCCs. In conclusion, stepwise SVM can effectively eliminate the noise in
data and improve the prediction accuracy.

## Bringing Multimix From Fortran To R {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Multimix is the name for a class of multivariate finite mixture models designed with clustering (<span>*unsupervised learning*</span>) in mind. It is also a name for a program to fit these models, written in Fortran77 by Lyn Hunt as part of her Waikato PhD thesis. 

**Why convert to R?** Although written in the 1990s Multimix is easy to convert to modern GNU Fortran (gfortran) but there are advantages to having an R version available. For users this means a simpler way of reading in the data and describing the form of the model. Also for ongoing development of improvement and modifications of the Multimix models. R's interactive environment provides a more comfortable place for experimentation. Designing the new program. Rather than attempt any sort of translation of the old code, the new R version of Multimix is designed from the beginning as an R program. In my talk I will describe some of the design decisions made and the reasons for them. A particular concern was that the R version be as fast as possible. 

**How to package up the new program?** Two versions of Multimix in R have been developed, a <span>*global*</span> version with many global variables employed, and a <span>*nested*</span> version restricting the scope of variables to the surrounding function. The pluses and minuses of each approach will be described. I am conscious that I may not always have made the best design decisions and comments from others will be welcomed.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> An empirical analysis of the mean return and conditional variance of
Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) index is performed using various error
innovations in GARCH models. Conventional GARCH model which assumed
normal error term failed to capture volatility clustering, leptokurtosis
and leverage effect as a result of zero skewness and kurtosis
respectively. We re-modify error distributions of GARCH (p,q) model
inference using some thick-tailed distributions. Method of Quasi-Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was used in parameter estimation. The robust
model that explained the NSE index is determined by loglikelihood and
model selection Criteria. Our result shows that GARCH model with
fat-tailed densities improves overall estimation for measuring
conditional variance. The GARCH model using Beta-Skewed-t distribution
is the most successful for forecasting NSE index.

## Bayesian Analyses Of Non-Homogeneous Gaussian Hidden Markov Models {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We investigate a non-homogeneous Gaussian
hidden Markov model where the model assumes the transition probabilities
between the hidden states depend on each discrete-time. The methodology
of the statistical inference for the model follows the Bayesian approach
implementing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for parameter
estimation. The methods include: the Metropolis-Hastings, the delayed
rejection Metropolis-Hastings, the multiple-try Metropolis-Hastings, and
the adaptive Metropolis algorithms.

For simulation studies, we have successfully implemented all the
algorithms proposed on the simulated data set that was investigated by
Diebold et al. (1994), although we had been faced with the difficulties
of estimating each parameter due to the large noises in the data. For a
case study, the model was implemented on a data set of the monthly US
3-month treasury bill rates with six financial exogenous variables in
which the settings are identical to that of Meligkotsidou and
Dellaportas’s (2011), except for the algorithm.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> The demand for and volume of data from
surveys, registers or other sources containing sensible information on
persons or enterprises have increased significantly over the last
several years. At the same time, privacy protection principles and
regulations have imposed restrictions on the access and use of
individual data. Proper and secure microdata dissemination calls for the
application of statistical disclosure control methods to the data before
release. Traditional approaches to (micro)data anonymization, including
data perturbation methods, disclosure risk methods, data utility and
methods for simulating synthetic data have been made available in R.
After introducing the audience to the R packages sdcMicro and simPop,
the presentation will focus on new developments and research for
generating close-to-reality synthetic data sets using specific
model-based approaches. The resulting data can work as a proxy of
real-world data and they are useful for training purposes, agent-based
and/or microsimulation experiments, remote execution as well as they can
be provided as public-use files. The strength and weakness of the
methods are highlighted and an (brief) application to the Euorpean
Statistics of Income and Living Condition Survey is given.

For this problem, we discuss an $L^2$-norm-based test for simultaneous
testing of mean vectors and covariance matrices among two non-normal
populations. To construct a test procedure, we propose a test statistic
based on both unbiased estimator of differences mean vectors proposed by
Chen and Qin (2010) and covariance matrices proposed by Li and Chen
(2012). Also, we derive an asymptotic distribution of this test
statistic and investigate the asymptotic sizes and powers of the
proposed test. Finally, we study the finite sample and dimension
performance of this test via Monte Carlo simulations.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Modeling and forecasting covariance matrices
of asset returns play a crucial role in finance. The availability of
high frequency intraday data enables the modeling of the realized
covariance matrix directly. However, most models in the literature
depend on strong structural assumptions and they also suffer from the
curse of dimensionality. To solve the problem, we propose a deep
learning model which treats each realized covariance matrix as an image.
The network structure is designed with simplicity in mind, and yet
provides superior accuracy compared with several advanced statistical
methods. The model could handle both low-dimensional and
high-dimensional realized covariance matrices.

## R In Industry – Application On Pipe Renewal Planning {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> R has become an increasingly used tool in industry to practically help
councils and organisations with their asset management challenges. We
will demonstrate some of the practical tools Harmonic Analytics has
developed using R to assist in asset management.

One specific example demonstrated will be recent work for a New Zealand
council that was experiencing challenges in long term planning around
its three waters infrastructure. In particular, challenges stem from the
limited information about pipe condition. Using past work order history
as proxy for pipe failures, we present a tool that uses a pipe break
model to inform replacement strategies. The developed tool allows users
to generate and compare both data driven and engineering based scenarios
through a variety of lenses, ranging from annual replacement length to
service level outcomes. A number of visualisations are available to
support comparisons. Data driven scenarios are driven from a variety of
perspectives, such as traditional age based replacement, probability of

## Empirical Comparison Of Some Algorithms For Automatic Univariate ARMA Modeling Using RcmdrPlugin.SPSS {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In some application of time series modeling,
it is necessary to obtain forecast of various types of data
automatically and possibly, in real-time. For instances, to forecast
large number of univariate series every day, or to do a real-time
processing of the satellite data. Various automatic algorithms for
modeling ARMA models are available in the literature, where here we will
discuss three methods in particular. One of the method is based on a
combination between the best exponential smoothing model to obtain the
forecast, together with state-space approach of the underlying model to
obtain the prediction interval (see Hyndman, 2007). The second method,
which is more advanced method, is based on X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the
seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau (see Sax , 2015).
From our previous study in Rosadi (2016), we found that these methods
are perform relatively well for SARIMA data. Unfortunately, these
approaches do not working well for many of ARMA data. Therefore in paper
we extend the study by considering an automatic modeling method based on
genetic algorithm approach (see Abo-Hammour, et.al., 2012). These
approaches are implemented in our R-GUI package RcmdrPlugin.Econometrics
which now already integrated in our new and more comprehensive R-GUI
package, namely RcmdrPlugin.SPSS. We provide application of the methods
and the tool. From some empirical studies, we found that for ARMA data,
the method based on genetic algorithm performs better than the other
approaches.

## Performance Of Bayesian Credible Interval For Binomial Proportion Using Logit Transformation {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The confidence or the credible interval of
the binomial proportion $p$ is one of most widely employed statistical
analysis methods, and a variety of methods have been proposed. The
Bayesian credible interval attracts recent researches’ attentions. One
of the promising methods is the highest posterior density (HPD)
interval, which implies the shortest possible interval enclosing
$100(1-\alpha)$% of the probability density function. The HPD interval
is often used because it is narrow compared to other credible intervals.
However, the HPD interval has some drawbacks when the binomial
proportion is a small. To dissolve them, we calculate first a credible
interval by the HPD interval of the logit transformed parameter,
$\theta=\log\{p/(1-p)\}$, instead of $p$. Note that $\theta$ and $p$ are
the canonical and the mean parameters of the binomial distribution in
the exponential family, respectively. Writing the HPD interval of
$\theta$ as $(\theta_{l}, \theta_{u})$, we define the proposed credible
interval of $p$ as
$(p_{l}, p_{u})= \big( e^{\theta_{l}} / ( 1+e^{\theta_{l}} ), \,  e^{\theta_{u}}/(1+e^{\theta_{u}}) \big)$.
It is explored in depth, and numerical comparison studies are conducted
to confirm its favorable performance, especially when the observed
number is small, such as 0 or 1. Practical datasets are analyzed to
examine the potential usefulness for applications in medical fields.

<span>**Abstract:**</span>
R has been used in the field of official statistics in Japan for over
ten years. This presentation takes up the case of the 2016 Economic
Census for Business Activity. The Census aims to identify the structure
of establishments and enterprises in all industries on a national and
regional level, and to obtain basic information to conduct various
statistical surveys by investigating the economic activity of these
establishments and enterprises. The major corporate accounting items,
such as sales, expenses and salaries, surveyed by the census require
imputation to avoid bias. Although ratio imputation is a leading
candidate, it is well known that the ratio estimator is very sensitive
to outliers; therefore, we need to take appropriate measures for this
problem.

Ratio imputation is a special case of regression imputation; however,
the conventional ratio estimator has a heteroscedastic error term, which
is the obstacle of robustification by means of M-estimation. New robust
ratio estimators are developed by segregating the homoscedastic error
term with no relation to the auxiliary variable from the original error.
The computation of the estimators are made by modifying iterative
reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, since it is easy to calculate
and fast to converge. The proposed robustified ratio estimator broadens
the conventional definition of the ratio estimator with regards to the
variance of the error term in addition to effectively alleviating the
influence of outliers. The application of the robust estimator is
expected to contribute to the accuracy of the Census results.

An random number simulation to confirm the characteristics of these
estimators, deciding imputation domains by CART (classification and
regression tree), model selection and preparing necessary rates by
domain for the census data processing are conducted within the R
programming environment.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient under
the normality assumption and High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS)
settings. In general, canonical correlation matrix is associated with
canonical correlation analysis which is useful in studying the
relationship between two sets of variables. However, in HDLSS settings,
the within-class sample covariance matrix $\hat{\Sigma}$ is singular,
because the rank of $\hat{\Sigma}$ is much less than the number of
dimension. To avoid the singularity of $\hat{\Sigma}$ in HDLSS settings,
we utilize the naive canonical correlation matrix with replacing sample
covariance matrix by its diagonal part only. We derive the asymptotic
normality of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient, and
compare the results of our numerical studies to the theoretical
asymptotic results.

## Applying Active Learning Procedure To Drug Consumption Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We apply the method of active learning to
build a binary classification model for drug consumption data. Due to
the nature of active learning, subject selection is an major issue is
its learning process. There are many kinds of subject selection schemes
proposed in the literature. The subject recruiting procedure may also
depend on its learning target criterion such as accuracy, area under ROC
curve and so on. Moreover, in practical active learning scenarios, the
label information of samples can only be revealed as they are recruited
into training data set, and we will pay the domain experts to label
these selected sample. Therefore, to consider the labelling cost,
how/when to stop an active learning procedure is always an important and
challenging problem in active learning. In this talk, we propose an
active learning procedure targeting at area under an ROC curve, and
based on the idea of robustness, we then used a modified influential
index to locate the most informative samples, sequentially, such that
the learning procedure can achieve the target efficiently. We then apply
our procedure to drug consumption data sets.

## R Package For New Two-Stage Methods In Forecasting Time Series With Multiple Seasonality {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Anupama Lakshmanan and Shubhabrata Das<br />
Indian Institute of Management Bangalore<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Complex multiple seasonality is an important emerging challenge in time
series forecasting. We propose a framework that segregates the task into
two stages. In the first stage, the time series is aggregated at the low
frequency level (such as daily or weekly) and suitable methods such as
regression, ARIMA or TBATS, are used to fit this lower frequency data.
In the second stage, additive or multiplicative seasonality at the
higher frequency levels may be estimated using classical, or
function-based methods. Finally, the estimates from the two stages are
combined.

In this work, we build a package for implementing the above two-stage
framework for modeling time series with multiple levels of seasonality
within R. This would make it convenient to execute and possibly lead to
more practitioners and academicians adopting it. The package would allow
the user to decide the specific methods to be used in the two stages and
also the separation between high and low frequency. Errors are
calculated for both model and validation period, which may be selected
by the user and model selection choices based on different criterion
will be facilitated. Forecast combination may also be integrated with
the developed routine. The schematics will be presented along with
demonstration of the package in several real data sets.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We introduce some important functions on a
secure computation system and empirically evaluate them using the
statistical computing software R. The secure computation is a
cryptographic technology that enables us to operate data while keeping
the data encrypted. Due to the remarkable aspect, we can construct a
secure on-line analytical system to protect against unauthorized access,
computer virus and internal fraud. Moreover, the function of secure
computation has a benefit for privacy.

So far, we developed a secure computation system that runs R as a
front-end application. In this research, we focus on the analysis of
official microdata using our secure computation system. By employing the
R script language to secure computation, we can potentially make new
functions for the analysis of official microdata on our secure
computation system. We show some examples of functions on the system
using the R script language. A demonstration experiment to verify the
practicality and scalability of the system in the field of official
statistics is also in our scope.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Flexi is a statistical program designed to fit variance
based models. In this talk I will explore the advantages and
disadvantages of the variance based model compared to the more commonly
adopted mean based approach. Several examples will be given where the
properties of variance based models provide a clearer understanding of
the data. To illustrate the differences in the approach to the data I
will compare Television and Progressive Graphics File methods of
transferring a picture. The Television builds up the global picture from
individual pixels describing a local area of the picture, whereas the
Progressive Graphics File proceeds from the global value of the median
colour of the whole picture to the local value of each individual pixel
by successive refinements. This gives a coarse blocky picture at the
start which refines into a detailed picture at the end. Mean based
models are like television pictures whereas variance based models are
like Progressive Graphics File pictures. The advantages and
disadvantages of the two methods will be discussed.

## Space And Circular Time Log Gaussian Cox Processes With Application To Crime Event Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We view the locations and times of a collection of crime events as a space-time point pattern modeled as either a nonhomogeneous Poisson process or a more general log Gaussian Cox process. We need to specify a space-time intensity. Viewing time as circular, necessitates a valid separable and nonseparable covariance functions over a bounded spatial region crossed with circular time. Additionally, crimes are classified by crime type and each crime event is marked by day of the year which we convert to day of the week.

We present marked point pattern models to accommodate such data. Our specifications
take the form of hierarchical models which we fit within a Bayesian framework. We consider
model comparison between the nonhomogeneous Poisson process and the log Gaussian Cox
process as well as separable vs. nonseparable covariance specifications. Our motivating
dataset is a collection of crime events for the city of San Francisco during the year 2012.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Suppose that there are multiple heterogeneous
subgroups in a dataset. In the “Big data” era, this would be a natural
assumption for many fields of application such as medicine, biology,
marketing, psychology, etc. Then, conventional linear regression models
result in not only poor prediction performance but also misleading
interpretation of analyses. In this study, we propose an extension of
cluster-wise regression models
$\phi^{-1}\left(\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})\phi(\vec{\beta}_k^\top\vec{x})\right)$,
where $\phi$ is a strictly increasing function,
$\vec{x}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, $\vec{\beta}_k$ is a regression coefficient
for $k$th cluster and $p_k(\vec{x})$ is a non-negative function
satisfying $\sum_{k=1}^Kp_k(\vec{x})=1$ for any $\vec{x}$. We show that
the proposed model has flexibility in clustering and “averaging”
multiple regressors and hence includes the existing methods such as
Späth (1981), DeSarbo et al. (1989) as special cases.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Gene-environment interactions (GEI) are known
to be one possible avenue for addressing the missing heritability
problem in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Although many
statistical methods have been proposed for identifying and analyzing
GEI, most of these consider interactions between a single genetic
variants such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) by the
environment. In this study, we proposed a new statistical method for
gene-based GEI analysis, Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of
Gene-Environment Interaction (HisCoM-GEI). HisCoM-GEI is based on
generalized structured component analysis, and can consider hierarchical
structural relationships among SNPs in a gene. HisCoM-GEI can
effectively aggregate all possible pairwise SNP-Environment interactions
into a latent variable by imposing a ridge penalty, from which it then
performs GEI analysis. Furthermore, HisCoM-GEI can evaluate both
gene-level and SNP-level analyses. We applied the HisCoM-GEI to the
cohort data of the Korea Associated Resource (KARE) consortium to
identify GEIs between genes and alcohol intake on the blood pressure
traits.

## Cross Covariance Estimation For Integration Of Multi-Omics Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In integrative analysis of multiple types of
-omics data, it is often of interest to infer associations between two
different types of molecules. The prevailing analysis methods depend on
ensemble of brute-force pairwise univariate association tests between
the two types, best exemplified by expression quantitative loci (eQTL)
mapping. In a nutshell, this problem can be generally framed as a sparse
cross-covariance matrix. In this work, we propose a two-stage estimator
of cross covariance matrix ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ between $p$-vector
${\mathbf{X}}$ and $q$-vector ${\mathbf{Y}}$, assuming that the two
variables have regulatory relationships and that we know a group
structure in the variables in ${\mathbf{X}}$. We first decompose the
covariance matrix of ${\mathbf{X}}$, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}$, into
systematic covariance consistent with the functional group information
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)}$ and the residual covariance not explained
by the group information ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}$. Following this
decomposition, we estimate the cross covariance matrix by multi-response
group lasso, yielding
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}= {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}{\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)} = ({\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)} + {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}) {\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)}$.
As a result of this decomposition, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ can also be
expressed as the sum of a systematic term and a residual term, breaking
down the cross-covariance into a fraction attributable to pathway-level
regulation and the rest. We applied the method to epigenetic regulation

Atlas invasive breast cancer cohort.

## Relationships Between Linguistic Characteristics And The Use Of Māori Loanwords In New Zealand English. {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Steven Miller and Andreea Calude<br />
University of Waikato<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We present the initial results from a project
looking at the linguistic and socio-linguistic characteristics that
affect the prevalence of Māori loanwords in the use of New Zealand
English, and describe the paths we see this research taking in the next
few years.

Loanwords are words that originate in one language (the donor language)
and enter into, and are productively used within another language (the
host language). For our initial research, we were particularly
interested in the use of Māori loanwords in spoken New Zealand English,
as found within the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English.

We used generalised linear mixed effects models to determine if there
were significant relationships between the linguistic characteristics of
the loanwords used / words replaced, demographic features of the
speakers, and the ethnicity of the audiences.

We found that linguistic characteristics of the loanwords and their
English counterparts affect the probability of using the loanword for
both Pākehā and Māori speakers, there was a difference in the
probability of using a loanword between the sexes for Māori speakers
only, and Māori speakers moderated the use of loanwords in conversations

## An Overview Of The Correspondence Analysis Family {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Correspondence analysis (CA) is well known to be a member of the family
of multivariate analysis techniques and is concerned with the
visualisation of the association between two or more categorical
variables. The classic texts of Greenacre (1984) and Lebart, Morineau
and Warwick (1984), for example, provide an excellent technical,
practical and historical account of development of CA up to that period.
What is less well known is that the literature on CA extends well beyond
the traditional approaches that can be found in many multivariate texts
and often there are disciplines that redefine the way in which it is
performed. For example, the various fields of ecology have successfully
germinated variants including <span>*canonical correspondence
analysis*</span> and <span>*detrended correspondence analysis*</span>.
However the scope, and literature, of CA is not confined to these
examples. Beh and Lombardo (2014, Section 1.6.3) and provide a
comprehensive list of members of the “family” which, now, number about
50 members. I shall provide an overview of some of the popular, and
not-so-popular, members of the CA family.

and practically prove to be robust to arbitrarily complex population

of methodologies, called a genotype-conditional association test, shown
to provide accurate association tests in populations with complex

are from the diverse sources such as ASOS(Automated Synoptic Observing
System) and AWS(Automatic Weather Station). The meteorological data in
South Korea is observed from about 100 ASOS and 500 AWS. In order to
produce the high qualified meteorological data, several data quality
control algorithms are applied. In this study, cluster analysis for
almost 600 meteorological sites is applied depending on their climatic
characteristics. After clustering, we propose the several threshold
algorithms in the given cluster. The proposed threshold values for data
quality control algorithms will be adequate to Korea climate condition
by cluster and month. Thresholds of QC algorithms, which are step test,
persistence test and climate range test, are determined. Through these
algorithms and threshold, the qualified meteorological data can be
produced for the improved forecast accuracy.

## Regularized Noise-Reduction Methodology For High-Dimensional Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk, we consider principal component
analysis (PCA) methods in high-dimensional settings. We first consider
asymptotic properties of the conventional estimator of eigenvalues. We
show that the estimator is affected by the high-dimensional noise
structure directly, so that it becomes inconsistent. In order to
overcome such difficulties in a high-dimensional situation, Yata and
Aoshima (2012) developed a new PCA method called the noise-reduction
(NR) methodology. We show that the NR method can enjoy consistency
properties not only for eigenvalues but also for PC directions in
high-dimensional settings. The estimator of the PC directions by the NR
method has a consistency property in terms of an inner product. However,
it does not hold a consistency property in terms of the Euclid norm.
With the help of a thresholding method, we modify the estimator and
propose a regularized NR method. We show that it holds the consistency
property of the Euclid norm. Finally, we check the performance of the
new NR method by using microarray data sets.

## Computation Of Influence Functions For Robust Statistics {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Robust statistics are often computed when outliers are present. One of
the diagnostics tools for assessing the robustness of estimation is the
influence function, which measures the impact on a statistic of adding
new data to or removing existing data from the data set. It is also
useful for computing the standard error of the statistic.

The computation of influence function for closed form estimates is
relatively easy in comparison to that for non-closed form estimates.
However, robust statistics are often not in closed form and are computed
using iterative algorithms. Obtaining the analytical form of the
empirical influence functions of robust statistics for multiple
parameters is rare in the current literature and not easy.

In this talk, I use matrix algebra including matrix derivation to show
how influence functions for robust statistics can be obtained
analytically, particularly in M-estimators with multiple of parameter
vectors.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper aims to propose a data-adaptive
model averaging estimation in the high-dimensional framework. To this
end, We first consider the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA) proposed by
Ing and Lai (2011) to construct a set of nested models. The
high-dimensional model averaging criteria (HDMMA) suggested by Ing
(2016) is considered upon the OGA nested models, while the penalty term
is unknown and needed to be estimated. We then use the cross-validation
to select the optimal penalty. This method of penalty selection is shown
to be optimally adaptive to a wide class of data generating processes.
Furthermore, the resultant HDMMA estimator based on the selected penalty
is shown to be asymptotic rate efficient. Finally, numerical studies in
this paper are expected to shed some light on the choice of data
splitting ratio for the cross-validation.

## Model-Based Clustering For Multivariate Categorical Data With Dimension Reduction {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Michio Yamamoto<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A novel model-based clustering procedure for
multivariate categorical data is proposed. The proposed model assumes
that each response probability has a low-dimensional representation of
the cluster structure, which is constructed by weights for categorical
variables and scores for cluster representatives. For the visualization
of the cluster structure, we define low-dimensional scores for
individuals as convex combinations of scores for cluster
representatives, which may be interpretable in a similar manner to the
archetypal analysis developed by Cutler and Breiman (1994). Because the
proposed model has the so-called rotational indeterminacy, it is needed
to conduct rotation methods after parameter estimation to obtain
interpretable results. Instead of this two-step approach, we develop a
penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a sparsity-inducing penalty
on the weights for categorical variables. To optimize the proposed
penalized likelihood criterion, we develop an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm with gradient projection and coordinate descent. It is
shown that there is trade-off relation between the convergence rate of
the algorithm and the cluster recovery.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> With the prevalent usage of microarray and
massively parallel sequencing, numerous high-throughput omics datasets
have become available in the public domain. Integrating abundant
information among omics datasets is critical to elucidate biological
mechanisms. Due to the high- dimensional nature of the data, methods
such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been widely applied,
aiming at effective dimension reduction and exploratory visualization.
In this paper, we combine multiple omics datasets of identical or
similar biological hypothesis and introduce two variations of
meta-analytic framework of PCA, namely MetaPCA. Regularization is
further incorporated to facilitate sparse feature selection in MetaPCA.
We apply MetaPCA and sparse MetaPCA to simulations, three transcriptomic
meta-analysis studies in yeast cell cycle, prostate cancer, mouse
metabolism, and a TCGA pan-cancer methylation study. The result shows
improved accuracy, robustness and exploratory visualization of the
proposed framework.

## Fitting Additive Hazards Model Using Calibrated Weights For Case-Cohort Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> A case-cohort design is an efficient study
design for analyzing failure time data by reducing the cost and effort
of conducting a large cohort study. Estimation of regression
coefficients is typically done through a weighted estimating equation
approach whose weight is the inverse of the sampling probabilities.
Several techniques to enhance the efficiency by estimating weights or
calibrating weights based on auxiliary variables have been developed for
Cox models. In this paper, we propose to extend these methodologies to
semiparametric additive hazards models. The proposed estimators are
demonstrated to be more efficient, via simulation studies, than the
usual Horvitz-Thompson type estimator. We illustrate a use of the
proposed estimators by using the National Wilms Tumor Study data.

## Selecting The Number Of Principal Components {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of
the most popular methods in multivariate data analysis, which can be
applied to covariance matrices. Despite the popularity of the method,
there is no widely adopted standard approach to select the number of
principal components to retain. To address this issue, we propose a
novel method utilizing the hypothesis testing framework and test whether
the currently selected principal components capture all the
statistically significant signals in the given data set. While existing
hypothesis testing approaches do not enjoy the exact type 1 error
property and lose power under some scenarios, the proposed method
provides an exact type 1 error control along with decent size of power
in detecting signals. Central to our work is the post-selection
inference framework which facilitates valid inference after data-driven
model selection; the proposed hypothesis testing method provides exact
type 1 error controls by conditioning on the selection event which leads
to the inference. We also introduce a possible extension of the proposed
method for high-dimensional data.

## Rolling Survival Extrapolation Algorithm For Estimating Life Years Lost Among Subjects Exposed To Long-Term Air Pollution {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Measure of expected years of life lost (EYLL) of a cohort of subjects
living with specific conditions would be useful for quantifying and
thereby comparing the societal burden of different conditions. One
promising approach of estimating EYLL is based on relative survival
between the index cohort and an age- and sex-matched reference
population generated from vital statistics to extrapolate survival
function of the index cohort. The EYLL is then estimated by computing
the area between the survival curve of the reference population and
extrapolated survival curve of the index cohort. In this talk, we will
introduce our newly developed method called rolling survival
extrapolation algorithm which consists of two major stages. First, we
apply logit transformation to the relative survival so that the
transformed curve beyond follow-up would approximate to a nearly
straight line. Second, similar to the rolling forecast process for
predicting the future over a set period of time, we take advantage of
the accurate short-term extrapolation of restricted cubic splines models
to guide the transformed relative survival forward step-by-step using
the model updated data. There are some studies that provide general
evidence for long-term associations of air pollution with hospital
admissions and death of various causes. We have found no published
epidemiological studies on the effects of long-term air pollution
exposure and life years lost. With the proposed method, we estimate EYLL
from long-term exposure to air pollution among Taiwanese adult
population at rural township and city district levels. The results show
that elderly people living in a worse local air pollution for decades
long had more expected years of life lost after adjusting social
economic status.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Microbial metagenomics data has large
inter-subject variation and operational taxonomic units (OTU) for each
species are usually very sparse. Because of these problems,
non-parametric approaches such as Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon
rank-sum test have been utilized. However these approaches suffer from
low statistical powers for association analyses and thus investigation
on efficient statistical analyses is necessary. Main goal in my thesis
is to propose phylogenetic Tree-based Microbiome Association Test (TMAT)
for association analyses between microbiome abundances of each OTU and
disease phenotype. Phylogenetic tree reveals similarity between
different OTUs, and thus was used to provide TMAT. TMAT calculates score
test statistics for each node and test statistics for all nodes are
combined into a single statistics by minimum p-value or Fisher’s combing
p-value method. TMAT was compared with existing methods with extensive
simulations. Simulation studies show that TMAT preserves the nominal
type-1 error and its statistical powers were usually much better than
existing methods for considered scenarios. Furthermore it was applied to
atopic diseases and found that community profiles of Enterococcus is
associated.

sampling through several data augmentations that effectively transform
the non-linear and non-Gaussian problem in zero-inflated regression

## Towards A Sparse, Scalable, And Stably Positive Definite (Inverse) Covariance Estimator {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Joong-Ho Won<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract**</span>: High dimensional covariance estimation and graphical models is a
contemporary topic in statistics and machine learning having widespread
applications. The problem is notoriously difficult in high dimensions as
the traditional estimate is not even positive definite. An important
line of research in this regard is to shrink the extreme spectrum of the
covariance matrix estimators. A separate line of research in the
literature has considered sparse inverse covariance estimation which in
turn gives rise to graphical models. In practice, however, a sparse
covariance or inverse covariance matrix which is simultaneously
well-conditioned and at the same time computationally tractable is
desired. There has been little research at the confluence of these three
topics. In this paper we consider imposing a condition number constraint
to various types of losses used in covariance and inverse covariance
matrix estimation. This extends the approach by Won, Lim, Kim, and
Rajaratnam (2013) on multivariate Gaussian log likelihood. When the loss
function can be decomposed as a sum of an orthogonally invariant
function of the estimate and its inner product with a function of the
sample covariance matrix, we show that a solution path algorithm can be
derived, involving a series of ordinary differential equations. The path
algorithm is at- tractive because it provides the entire family of
estimates for all possible values of the condition number bound, at the
same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper bound.
An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition
number constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing
loss functions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield
non-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this
path algorithm. As a concrete illustration of its practical importance,
we develop an operator-splitting algorithm that imposes a guarantee of
well-conditioning as well as positive definiteness to recently proposed
convex pseudo-likelihood based graphical model selection methods (Zhang
and Zou, 2014; Khare, Oh, and Rajaratnam, 2015).

## Tick-By-Tick Effect On The Inference Of Ultra-High Frequency Data {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> In the inference of ultra-high frequency data, the existing
methods are challenged by the tick-by-tick effect, namely, the
transactions recorded simultaneously at a time point. In this talk, we
will discuss how it influences the estimation of integrated volatility
matrix. The effect of microstructure noise and jumps will be discussed
as well. We propose to use a double-averaging procedure to deal with
these issues. The related asymptotic distribution of the proposed
estimator is established. Even interestingly, the double-averaging
estimator achieves the "oracle"" property, that is, the asymptotic
efficiency is the same as that of the case that the exact trading time
of transactions are fully observed. Simulation studies support the
theoretical results. The estimation procedure is illustrated through a
real data analysis.

## Lattice Polytope Samplers {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Statistical inverse problems occur when we
wish to learn about some random process that is observed only
indirectly. Inference in such situations typically involves sampling
possible values for the latent variables of interest conditional on the
indirect observations. This talk is concerned with inverse problems for
count data, for which the latent variables are constrained to lie on the
integer lattice within a convex polytope (a bounded multidimensional
polyhedron). An illustrative example arises in transport engineering
where we observe vehicle counts entering or leaving each zone of the
network, then want to sample possible interzonal patterns of traffic
flow consistent with those entry/exit counts. Other problems with this
structure arise when conducting exact inference for contingency tables,
and when analysing capture-recapture data in ecology.

In principle such sampling can be conducted using Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods through a random walk on the lattice polytope, but it is
challenging to design algorithms for doing so that are both
computationally efficient and have guaranteed theoretical properties.
The seminal work of Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998) on Markov bases
addresses some of the theoretical issues, but has significant practical
limitations. In this talk I shall discuss some preliminary findings
based on a more geometric approach to sampler design.

## Statistical Modelling And Analysis Of Cosmic Microwave Background Data {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is a
remarkable research area in cosmology whose results won two Nobel prizes
in physics in 1978 and 2006 for the discovery of the CMB radiation and
its anisotropy. Spurred on by a wealth of satellite data, intensive
investigations in the past few years have resulted in many relevant
physical and mathematical formalisms to describe and characterise CMB
radiation. At the same time, these investigations have raised a number
of challenges, theoretical and practical. Studies of deviations from
isotropy and Gaussianity, the two fundamental assumptions of
cosmological models of the early Universe, form the core of recent
experimental and theoretical research in cosmology.

Recent results on modelling CMB evolution and approximation of
corresponding random fields will be discussed. Some new approaches to
test Gaussianity using multifractality will be illustrated using CMB
data. Finally, a new R package for CMB data will be presented.

The presentation is based on joint research with Vo Anh (QUT),

## Measure Of Departure From Marginal Average Point-Symmetry For Two-Way Contingency Tables With Ordered Categories {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> For the analysis of two-way contingency
tables with ordered categories, Yamamoto, Tahata, Suzuki and Tomizawa
(2011) considered a measure to represent the degree of departure from

distinguish two kinds of marginal complete asymmetry with respect to the
midpoint. The present article proposes a measure which can distinguish
two kinds of marginal asymmetry with respect to the midpoint. It also

## Sparse Estimates From Dense Precision Matrix Posteriors {.unnumbered}

Beatrix Jones and Amir Bashir<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A variety of computationally efficient
Bayesian models for the covariance matrix of a multivariate Gaussian
distribution are available. However, all produce a relatively dense
estimate of the precision matrix, and are therefore unsatisfactory when
one wishes to use the precision matrix to consider the conditional
independence structure of the data. This talk considers the posterior of
model fit for these covariance models. We then undertake post-processing
of the Bayes point estimate for the precision matrix to produce a sparse
model whose expected fit lies within the upper 95% of the posterior over
fits. Extensions to finding sparse differences between inverse
covariance matrices are also considered. We illustrate our findings with
moderate dimensional data examples from metabolomics.

## Dimension Reduction Strategies For Modeling Bi-Clustered High Dimensional Data {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Michael Van Supranes and Joseph Ryan Lansangan<br />
University of the Philippines Diliman<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> A three-stage framework is developed for fitting a mixture of
regressions for high dimensional data. The method combines a
hierarchical agglomerative grouping algorithm, regression-based
clustering, and a sequential, group-wise sparse estimation called
Layered Elastic Net Selection (LENS). A simulation study is used to
compare the method with LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
predictive accuracy, selection optimality, and clustering accuracy. All
simulation scenarios are high dimensional (n&lt;&lt;p), wherein the best
subset of predictors may or may not vary among clusters. When the group
of most important predictors varies among regression components, the
combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and LENS for mixture of
regressions outperforms LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
prediction and clustering accuracy. Based on simulation, the method
(termed as MixLENS) results to optimal variable selection, and applying
OLS on selected variables results to better prediction and clusters.
OLS-MixLENS may result to a more interpretable model that is as
predictive as a full model (e.g. Mixture of PC Regressions). In general,
MixLENS is likely to select an optimal small subset of predictors for
modeling.

## Computing Entropies With Nested Sampling {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> The Nested Sampling algorithm, invented in
the mid-2000s by John Skilling, represented a major advance in Bayesian
computation. Whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are usually
effective for sampling posterior distributions, Nested Sampling also
calculates the marginal likelihood integral used for model comparison,
which is a computationally demanding task. However, there are other
kinds of integrals that we might want to compute. Specifically, the
entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, which quantify
uncertainty and relevance, are all integrals whose form is inconvenient
in most practical applications. I will present my technique, based on
Nested Sampling, for estimating these quantities for probability
distributions that are only accessible via MCMC sampling. This includes
posterior distributions, marginal distributions, and distributions of
derived quantities. I will present an example from experimental design,
where one wants to optimise the relevance of the data for inference of a
parameter.

## Spline-Based Drift Models For High Temperature Operating Life Tests {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Vera Hofer and Thomas Nowak<br />
University of Graz<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the proper operation of semiconductor devices is of crucial importance for the reliability of a vast range of products, issues
concerning quality control are of central relevance to manufacturers.
This quality control task is concerned with high temperature operating
life tests, where devices are exposed to high temperatures, pressures or
humidity, which causes the devices to age artificially fast.

Based on measurements of a random sample of devices, the aim of this
work is to compute tolerance limits, such that all subsequent
measurements during the stress test stay within their predefined
specification limits with a given high probability. These tolerance
limits can then be used by automated test equipment for the quality
control of devices directly from the production line without their prior
exposure to stress test conditions.

In this study, we model the drift behavior of electrical parameters
using linear and cubic hermite splines, which are assumed to resemble
the true, yet unobserved drift behavior. These spline models allow for
the computation of probabilities for an electrical parameter to stay or
leave its specification limits at a given point in time. While a very
restrictive choice of the tolerance limits might achieve a high level of
reliability, the resulting yield loss might get unnecessarily high.
Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
probability for initial measurements to be within the tolerance limits
(in order to minimize the resulting yield loss) and where the
reliability requirement is formulated as a constraint. A derivative-free
search algorithm is proposed for this optimization problem, which is
then used to test the performance and validity of the model.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> High dimensional data exist in digital images, financial time series and
gene expression microarrays. Dealing with high dimensionality has become
a challenge, where the difficulty lies on how to visualize and explore
the high dimensional function or data set. Gene shaving is a statistical
method which is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that has
proven its worth in visualization and exploration of microarray data. In
this paper, the gene shaving algorithm was modified using PCA and Sparse
Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), and the modified algorithms were
explored in terms dimension reduction and clustering of variables in a
more general (not necessarily microarray) high dimensional data
setting.The proposed algorithms were evaluated through a simulation
study. Simulation results suggest that the modified algorithms identify
a singly cluster of variables that may already best explain the
variations in the entire data and/or that already are the most
informative. Also, the algorithms may produce overlapping clusters,
whose variables in the succeeding clusters (other than the first
cluster) are those that may provide information not inherent to the
first cluster. The modified algorithms are thus potential and useful for
exploration and identification of a group of variables worth for further
investigation, as well as clustering/groups of variables for
understanding variable structures/relationships.

## A Simple Method To Construct Confidence Bands In Functional Linear Regression {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper develops a simple method to construct confidence bands,
centered at a principal component analysis (PCA) based estimator, for
the slope function in a functional linear regression model with a scalar
response variable and a functional predictor variable. The PCA- based
estimator is a series estimator with estimated basis functions, and so
construction of valid confidence bands for it is a non-trivial
challenge. We propose a confidence band that aims at covering the slope
function at “most” of points with a prespecified probability (level),
and prove its asymptotic validity under suitable regularity conditions.
Importantly, this is the first paper that derives confidence bands
having theoretical justifications for the PCA-based estimator. We also
propose a practical method to choose the cut-off level used in PCA-based
estimation, and conduct numerical studies to verify the finite sample
performance of the proposed confidence band. Finally, we apply our
methodology to spectrometric data, and discuss extensions of our
methodology to cases where additional vector-valued regressors are
present.

## Separation Of Symmetry For Square Contingency Tables With Ordinal Categories {.unnumbered}

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Symmetry and asymmetry models are used to
analyze a <span>*square*</span> contingency table with ordinal
categories. Caussinus (1966) pointed out that the symmetry model, which
indicates the structure of symmetry for cell probabilities, could be
separated into the structure of symmetry for odds-ratios and that of
symmetry for marginal distributions. This result provides the reason for
poor fit of the symmetry model when it occurs for a real dataset. Also,
other separations of the symmetry model have been given. For example,
Kateri and Agresti (2007), and Saigusa et al. (2015). In this paper, we
consider the separation of symmetry by using the generalized asymmetry
models. A theorem which the likelihood ratio statistic for testing
goodness of fit of the symmetry model is asymptotically equivalent to
the sum of those for testing the generalized asymmetry model and the
moment equality model under some conditions is given. A simulation study
is presented.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> As big data become more accessible with the boom of data analyzing
software, creating value through analytics has grown in demand. Dealing
with large data sets in anomaly detection problems, accurate tagging of
anomalies is oftentimes lacking and expensive. Unsupervised learning via
clustering analysis can be performed to derive labelled data, but used
alone, is prone to high false alarm rates. We propose a nonparametric
procedure to test presence of clustering effect in a multilevel model
with a large set of predictors. Model estimation is done through
principal component regression (PCR) and two-way analysis-of-variance
(ANOVA), embedded in a backfitting algorithm. Hypothesis test is based
on sieve bootstrap. A simulation study showed that the test is effective
in detecting high clustering effects, and is optimal when sample size
exceeds the number of predictors. The test can be a useful support tool
to help address limitations of existing cluster-based methods in anomaly
detection.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Over the last two decades generalized
additive models (GAMs) have become an indispensible tool for modern data
analysis and regression. First-generation GAMs as developed by Hastie
and Tibshirani are based on backfitting (e.g., the `gam` R package).
Second-generation GAMs have automatic smoothing parameter selection
(e.g., the `mgcv` package by Simon Wood) and are based on, e.g.,
P-splines. Until recently, these two implementations were largely
confined to the exponential family. However, since the 1990s, the vector
generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes were developed
by Yee and coworkers, and these are a much larger class of models.
First-generation VGAMs were based on vector splines and vector
backfitting. This talk will describe 2nd-generation VGAMs using
O-splines and P-splines. We illustrate them by examples, to show that
automatic smoothing parameter selection based on optimizing a predictive
quantity such as generalized cross validation can be very useful. The
speaker’s `VGAM` package implementation will be described.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> As recent requirements for numerical
computation performed by R become larger and more complicated, errors
from floating-point arithmetic become problematic. In R, double
precision floating-point arithmetic is usually performed, but it may not
be adequate or precise for some situations. To avoid and detect errors
of double precision floating-point arithmetic, multiple precision
arithmetic is useful. Several multiple precision arithmetic packages
exist on R, but their abilities are limited. Therefore we provide
another multiple precision arithmetic package Rmpenv, which can handle
multiple precision arithmetic for real and complex numbers, matrix
product and inversion, etc. We also provide a syntactic sugar to make
easy the multiple precision computation on R. We utilize a free and open
source MPACK library for multiple precision arithmetic and linear
algebra computation.

Then we divide them into small number of groups which have clear domain
meanings. We express each group by using information up to second order
moments. For example, means, variances and covariances are used to
summarize many continuous real variables, and a Burt matrix which
consists of contingency tables by pairs of categorical variables are
used to summarize many categorical variables. We call such a set of
descriptive statistics “aggregated symbolic data (ASD)”.

We here propose dissimilarities between two ASDs by utilizing
pseudo-likelihood ratio test statistic and chi-squared test statistic.
Former one is theoretically derived and the latter one is heuristically
given. We adopt two dissimilarities for clustering districts in Tokyo by
ASD derived from huge real estate data.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We discuss a method of meta-analysis based on
symbolic data analysis (SDA). Meta-analysis, mainly used in social and
medical science, is a statistical method of combining scientific studies
to obtain quantitative results and provides a high level of evidence.
Differences between the studies are caused by heterogeneity between the
studies. It is useful to detect relationship among scientific studies. A
target of analysis on SDA is <span>*concept*</span>, a set of
individuals. We apply SDA to meta-analysis. In other words, we regard
scientific studies as concepts. For example, symbolic clustering or
symbolic MDS are useful to preprocess the scientific studies in
meta-analysis. In this study, we propose a new approach based on SDA for
meta-analysis and show the results of the proposed approach using
clinical datasets.

## Bayesian Static Parameter Inference For Partially Observed Stochastic Systems {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> We consider Bayesian static parameter
estimation for partially observed stochastic systems with discrete-time
observations. This is a very important problem, but is very
computationally challenging as the associated posterior distributions
are highly complex and one has to resort to discretizing the associated
probability law of the underlying stochastic system and advanced Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to infer the parameters. We are
interested in the situation where the discretization is in multiple
dimensions. For instance, for partially observed stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs), where dicretization is in both space and
time. In such cases, multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC) is known to have the
potential to reduce the computational cost for a prescribed level of
error, relative to i.i.d. sampling from the most precise discretization.
We demonstrate how MCMC and particularly particle MCMC can be used in
the multi-index framework for Bayesian static parameter inference for
the above-mentioned models. The main idea involves constructing an
approximate coupling of the posterior density of the joint on the
parameter and hidden space and then correcting by an importance sampling
method. Our method is illustrated numerically to be preferable for
inference of parameters for a partially observed SPDE.

## Consistency Of Linear Mixed-Effects Model Selection With Inconsistent Covariance Parameter Estimators {.unnumbered}

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> For linear mixed-effects models with data
collected within one cluster, the maximum likelihood estimators of
covariance parameters cannot be estimated consistently. Hence the
asymptotic behaviors of likelihood-based information criteria, such as
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) are rarely discussed in literature.
In the contrast, the number of the clusters is generally assumed going
to infinity with the sample size to guarantee the consistency of the
covariance parameter estimators and thereby guarantees the consistency
of the model selection procedures. In this talk, under some mild
conditions, we establish asymptotic theorems for ML estimators of
covariance parameters when the number of clusters is fixed. Furthermore,
the asymptotic behaviors of the generalized information criterion, which
includes AIC as special cases, are well studied in our research.

## An Incomplete-Data Fisher Scoring With An Acceleration Method {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Keiji Takai<br />

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Incomplete data complicate conventional statistical analyses because the
analyses presume complete data are always available. The primary problem
is the complication of the parameter estimation. The parameter
estimation is based on the observed-data log-likelihood function that
consists of the sum of the logarithm of the marginalized likelihood with
respect to the missing values, and thus the log-likelihood function
becomes complicated to handle. The EM algorithm was proposed to make it
easy to handle the log-likelihood function. However, the EM algorithm
still has some problems that are often criticized (McLachlan and
Krishnan, 2002); namely, slow convergence and unavailability of the
standard error.

In my talk, I propose an incomplete-data Fisher scoring (IFS) method
with an acceleration method to overcome these problems. The IFS method
takes a Newton-Raphson type iteration, but it produces exactly the
identical sequence or an approximate sequence to the sequence produced
by the EM algorithm. The notable feature of the IFS is that the IFS can
accelerate itself by adjusting its steplength and can produce the
standard error with the functions used only for the acceleration. The
convergence rate is faster than the EM algorithm. In the talk, I provide
the convergence theorem and practical examples.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> When we have new “big data”, the first step
may be to visualize them. For visualizing continuous multivariate data,
interactive parallel coordinate plot is known to be appropriate.
However, the number of data is huge and some variables are categorical,
a simple parallel coordinate plot is not available. We propose to divide
big data into rather small groups and summarize them as aggregated
symbolic data (ASD), and visualize them by triangular arranged parallel
coordinate plots.

We have developed a statistical graphics software for this purpose. Our
software equips interactive operations such as selection and linked
highlighting, and is written by Java, R, and big data processing
technologies such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.

Aggregated symbolic data is a set of descriptive statistics calculated
by up to second order moments of variables in each group. We also
propose further summarization of ASD to describe characteristics of each
variable and a pair of variables for visualizing the difference among
ASDs. Real example data are visualized by our software and interpreted
intuitively.

## Comparison Of Tests Of Mean Difference In Longitudinal Data Based On Block Resampling Methods {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">

</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Let us consider a two-sample problem in
longitudinal data, and discuss comparison of tests of mean difference
using block resampling methods. The testing methods are based on moving
block bootstrap (MBB), circular block bootstrap (CBB) and stationary
bootstrap (SB). These block resampling techniques are used to
approximate the null distributions of the following four types of test
statistics: sum of absolute values of difference between two mean
sequences ($T_1$), sum of squares of difference between two mean
sequences ($T_2$), area-difference between two mean curves ($T_3$), and
difference of kernel estimators based on two mean sequences ($S_n$). Our
testing algorithm generates blocks of observations in each sample
similar to MBB, CBB or SB, and draws resamples *with replacement* or
*without replacement* from the mixed blocks which are generated by two
samples. In the context of block resampling, a resample is usually
generated *with replacement* from blocks of observations, however our
discussion also includes block resampling *without replacement* similar
to permutation analogy for MBB, CBB and SB, with $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$ and
$S_n$, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to examine
the empirical level and power of the testing methods.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Most existing methods for GWAS data analysis
require individual-level genotype data as their input. However, it is
often not easy to get access to individual-level data, due to many
practical issues, such as privacy protection and disagreement on
data-sharing among multiple research groups. In this talk, we introduce
SSREM, a Summary-Statistics-based approach to estimating heritability,
co-heritability and effect sizes in GWAS data analysis. This is achieved
by Bayesian analysis with the standard random-effect prior and a
summary-statistics-based likelihood function. We have implemented a
parallel Gibbs sampling strategy, which allows us to handle
genome-wide-scale datasets. Our analysis results suggest that
summary-statistics-based analysis can achieve comparable performance to
individual-level data analysis.

## Selecting Generalised Linear Models Under Inequality Constraints {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Daniel Gerhard<br />
University of Canterbury<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Model selection by information criteria can
be used to identify a single best model or for inference based on
weighted support from a set of competing models, incorporating model
selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of
precision. Anraku (1999) proposed a modified version of the well known
Akaike information criterion, selecting models in the one-way analysis
of variance models when the population means are subject to monotone
trends. A generalization of this order-restricted information criterion
was proposed by Kuiper et al. (2011), allowing a restriction of
population means by a mixture of linear equality and inequality
constraints.

An extension to this approach is presented, applying the generalized
order-restricted information criterion to model selection from a set of
generalized linear models. The class of models can comprise linear
equality or inequality constraints of population parameters assuming a
distribution of the exponential family for the response. The methodology
is illustrated using the open source environment R with the add-on
package `goric`.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> Nonlinear multivariate methods (NL-MM) using
optimal scaling as a quantification technique can analyze any data
including quantitative and qualitative variables. The alternating least
squares (ALS) algorithm is the most popular iterative algorithm in
NL-MM. While the algorithm has a stable convergence property, it
requires many iterations and a large computational cost, especially for
a large data set involving many qualitative variables, because its
convergence is linear. It is therefore important to improve the speed of
computation when NL-MM with the ALS algorithm is applied. Kuroda and his
co-workers tried to accelerate the convergence of the ALS algorithm
using the vector $\varepsilon$ (v$\varepsilon$) accelerator. In this
talk, the v$\varepsilon$ acceleration for the ALS algorithm is
implemented in NL-MM, e.g., nonlinear principal component analysis and
nonlinear factor analysis, and the performances are demonstrated in
numerical experiments.

## Towards An Informal Test For Goodness-Of-Fit {.unnumbered}
<p style="text-align:center">
Anna Fergusson and Maxine Pfannkuch<br />
University of Auckland<br />
</p>
<span>**Abstract:**</span> Informal approaches to goodness-of-fit tests often involve examining the
visual fit of the model to data ’by eye’. Such approaches are
problematic for Year 13 and undergraduate students and teachers from a
pedagogical perspective as key aspects such as sample size, the number
of categories and expected variation of sample proportions are difficult
to consider. In formal tests for goodness-of-fit a test statistic is
used in reference to its sampling distribution to decide if the model
distribution can be rejected. In general, a numeric test statistic does
not have an obvious graphical representation within the data itself.
This talk presents a new informal goodness-of-fit test that uses a
simulation-based modelling tool. Drawing on ideas from graphical
inference, the proposed test does not use numerical test statistics but
plots as test statistics. Comparisons of performance demonstrate that
the proposed test leads to similar decisions about the fit of the model
distribution as the chi square goodness-of-fit test. A research study
with Year 13 teachers indicated that there could be pedagogical benefits
of using this informal goodness-of-fit test in terms of introducing
important modelling and hypothesis test concepts.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> In spatial data, detecting regions with
higher relative risk is of primary interest. A latent Markov random
field model with Gaussian mixture component is introduced, in which the
probit or the logit of the mixture weight for each location follows a
Gaussian Markov random field such as an intrinsic auto-regressive model
(Besag *et al.*, 1991). A mixture model with spatially correlated
weights was proposed by Fernández and Green (2002), and our modeling
with Gaussian mixture Markov random field can be extended to the cases
of involving covariate and random effects. Parameters are estimated by a
Bayesian approach, and the posterior mean of the mixture weight for each
location, which varies smoothly, gives meaningful interpretation for
spatial structure. Our computation was conducted with R Stan package, in
which the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is implemented. Some
applications to disease mapping data are illustrated.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> For the purpose of feature selection in
ultra-high dimensional regression models, it is required that a sequence
of candidate models and a criterion to select the “best” model from them
are available. Under different scenarios, various methods have been
proposed to achieve these two goals. Intuitively, it is straightforward
to choose appropriate loss and penalty functions in a regularization
method to accommodate specific characteristics of the data. However, the
computation could be expensive for certain cases. From recent studies,
we can see that sequential method is promising to produce good candidate
models for ultra-high dimensional data. Moreover, it can be easily
extended to complex models other than the linear regression model. In
this paper, we propose a new feature selection method based on robust
estimation.

<span>**Abstract:**</span> We consider feature selection in multivariate
regression models where the response variables as well as the covariates
are high-dimensional and both have intrinsic group structures. The
models arise naturally in many biology studies for detecting
associations between multiple traits and multiple features where the
traits and features are embedded in biological functioning groups such
as genes or pathways. We propose a sequential procedure for selecting
the feature groups based on a correlation principle. At each step of the
procedure, the response groups are fitted to already selected feature
groups and the residuals are obtained for the response groups, then, the
feature group which has the highest correlation with the residuals of
any response group is selected next. The correlation measure is the
trace of the sample canonical correlation matrix between two vectors.
The EBIC is used as the stopping rule of the procedure. This procedure
possesses the property of selection consistency. Compared with a group
penalization approach, our method is more accurate and demands much less
computation.
