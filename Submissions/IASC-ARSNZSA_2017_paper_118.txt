This study investigated the outcomes of a brief telephone intervention for problem gambling. A total of 150 callers were recruited and followed for 36 months. After giving consent, participants received a baseline assessment followed by a manualised version of the helpline's standard care. Eight-six percent of participants were re-assessed at three months, 79% at six months, 66% at 12 months, and 40% at 36 months.  There was no evidence of major differential attrition consequently no adjustments were made to the data.
Depression is found to often be associated with problem gambling behaviour, and analysis was undertaken to examine the impact of a brief telephone intervention for problem gambling on rates of depression using logistic regression. At baseline depression was found to be associated with gender, problem gambling risk (PGSI), and deprivation (NZiDep). A multiple variable model found that PGSI and mental health medication best explained depression at baseline. A repeated measures logistic regression utilising all 36 months of data found that PGSI, NZiDep, and mental health medication were the best variables to explain the change over time.
Conclusion was that the intervention's impact on problem gambling behaviour also changed depression rates, however deprivation and mental health medication also contributed.
