There are five species of fishes of the genus Galaxias that make up whitebait catches in New Zealand, although one species (G. maculatus) makes up >90% of the catch. Whitebait are immature post-larval fish that have yet to develop the distinctive morphological traits of adults. However, in their tiny stages as whitebait the five species are difficult to tell apart. There are also distinct spatial (rivers) and temporal (different months in the whitebait fishing season) differences among the species and even within species. To manage the fishery better it is necessary to identify regional differences in the species composition of catches, which is difficult because of the time and effort required to sample catches and identify species morphologically or genetically. In my study, I will use a recently compiled database comprising 17,000 entries of whitebait samples, species composition, and variability to develop a statistical model to predict the likelihood of species-to-species composition of catches throughout New Zealand. This probabilistic model could potentially be a powerful tool in the fishery and conservation of whitebait species, some of which are considered to be threatened.
