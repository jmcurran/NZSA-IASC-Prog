The New Zealand rugby community is aware of safety issues within the junior game and has applied weight limits for each tackle grade to minimize injury risk. However, for heavier children this can create an uncomfortable situation as they may no longer be playing with their peer group. The study evaluated almost 13,000 observations from junior rugby players across three seasons (2015-2017) using data supplied by Wellington Rugby. To protect privacy, the data was structured so that an individual could not be readily identified but could be tracked across seasons to determine churn. As data for several consecutive seasons was available, we could determine the likelihood of a junior player returning the following season and isolate the drivers of this behaviour. Applying a logistic regression and repeated measures analysis the study determined if children who are over the specified weight limit for their age group are more likely to leave the game. Furthermore, assuming the importance of playing with peers, the study identified the impact of age in relation to the date-of-birth cut-off of January 1st. This is of interest given that a child playing above their age-weight grade could be competing against individuals three school years above them. The study primarily focuses on determining the optimal age-weight bands while the secondary focus is on determining the likelihood of a junior Wellington rugby player returning the following season and isolating the drivers of this behaviour.
