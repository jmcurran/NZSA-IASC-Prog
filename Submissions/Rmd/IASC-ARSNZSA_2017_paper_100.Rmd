<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recently, deep learning techniques have shown
remarkably strong performance in problems involving unstructured data
(ex. text, image, and video). One of the reasons for this success is the
ability of deep learning methods to learn multiple levels of abstraction
and feature interaction. However, the advantages of using deep learning
techniques for structured/ event/transactional data has not been studied
in detail. The purpose of this paper is to review the advantages and
limitations of using deep feed forward networks on structured data. This
is achieved by comparing the performance of deep feed forward networks
with conventional machine learning techniques applied on a large
structured dataset for classification problem. The paper also describes
methodologies for optimizing the deep feed forward networks to achieve
better accuracy and different approaches to reduce over fitting for deep
feed forward network. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore the
effect of hyper parameter tuning on model performance. We also derive
practical advice from our extensive empirical results for those
interested in getting most out of deep feed forward networks for real
world settings.
