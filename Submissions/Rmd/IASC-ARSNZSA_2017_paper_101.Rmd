<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recently, there have been various types of time series data, such as
daily stock prices and Web-click logs, that have complicated the
structure. In several cases, because of the complexity, time series data
cannot satisfy the stationary process assumption. REGIMECAST (Matsubara
and Sakura, 2016) has been proposed as a method to forecast time series
data. It is useful for capturing changes in time series patterns and
representing the non-linear system. However, it cannot adequately
represent time series data after radical changes. Generally, radical
changes in time series data can be detected using existing methods, such
as change-point detection and anomaly detection. These methods are
rarely used for forecasting time series data, although these data often
show different behaviors after radical changes.

In this study, we propose a method that can forecast future time series
data after events involving radical changes. The method has two
features: i) appropriate pattern discovery, as it recognizes the
appropriate learning section with change-point detection, and ii)
flexible representation, as it represents non-stationary processes with
a non-linear state space model. We also provide empirical examples using
a variety of real datasets.
