<span>**Abstract:**</span> Correlated failure time data arise in many
biomedical studies, due to multiple occurrences of the same disease in
an individual patient. To account for this correlation phenomenon, we
formulate a random effect (frailty) survival model with an
autoregressive (AR) covariance structure and adopt the generalized
linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology for estimation of regression and
variance component parameters. A more general case of the problem is
also considered via a multilevel random effect approach where the
correlation of survival times is induced by a hierarchical clustering
structure, such as the appearances of repeated failures in patients from
the same hospital in a multicentre clinical trial setting. Our modelling
problem is used to investigate prognostic and treatment effects on
disease relapses in two data sets, (1) tumour recurrences in bladder
cancer patients and (2) recurrent infections in children with chronic
granulomatous disease (CGD). Using the first data set, the effect of
treatment thiotepa was found to be insignificant but demonstrated an
effect in reducing tumour recurrences with adjusted hazard ratio (AHR)
of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.29-1.16, p=0.124). The initial number of tumours
(AHR: 1.26, 95% CI: 1.08-1.47, p=0.004) had significant positive effect
but the effect of the size of the largest initial tumour was
insignificant. In the case of the CGD data, treatment gamma interferon
showed a significant decreasing effect (AHR: 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.56,
p$<$0.001) on the incidence of recurrent infections. In addition, age
effect was significant (AHR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.81-1.0, p=0.042). Pattern
of inheritance, height, weight, sex, use of corticosteroids and
prophylactic antibiotics did not exhibit significant association with
recurrent infections. The appropriateness of our modelling methodology
is investigated in a simulation study. The simulation results show that
parameters are satisfactorily estimated in the special case where AR
random effect is merely used. However, in the multilevel context bias in
the variance parameter of random hospital effect increases as the true
magnitude of variation in hospital effects increases.
