<span>**Abstract:**</span> In confirmatory clinical trials, the efficacy of a test treatment are
sometimes assessed by using multiple primary endpoints. We consider a
trial in which the efficacy of a test treatment is confirmed only when
it is superior to control for at least one of the endpoints and not
clinically inferior for the remaining endpoints. Nakazuru et al. (2014)
proposed a testing procedure that is applicable to the above case when
endpoints are continuous variables. In this presentation, firstly, we
propose a testing procedure in the case that all of the endpoints are
binary.

Westfall and Troendle (2008) proposed multivariate permutation tests.
Using this methods, we also propose an exact multiple testing procedure.

Finally, we compare an exact and approximate testing procedures proposed
above. The performance of the proposed procedures was examined through
Monte Carlo simulations.
