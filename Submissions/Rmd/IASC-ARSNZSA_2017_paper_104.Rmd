<span>**Abstract:**</span> High dimensional data exist in digital images, financial time series and
gene expression microarrays. Dealing with high dimensionality has become
a challenge, where the difficulty lies on how to visualize and explore
the high dimensional function or data set. Gene shaving is a statistical
method which is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) that has
proven its worth in visualization and exploration of microarray data. In
this paper, the gene shaving algorithm was modified using PCA and Sparse
Principal Component Analysis (SPCA), and the modified algorithms were
explored in terms dimension reduction and clustering of variables in a
more general (not necessarily microarray) high dimensional data
setting.The proposed algorithms were evaluated through a simulation
study. Simulation results suggest that the modified algorithms identify
a singly cluster of variables that may already best explain the
variations in the entire data and/or that already are the most
informative. Also, the algorithms may produce overlapping clusters,
whose variables in the succeeding clusters (other than the first
cluster) are those that may provide information not inherent to the
first cluster. The modified algorithms are thus potential and useful for
exploration and identification of a group of variables worth for further
investigation, as well as clustering/groups of variables for
understanding variable structures/relationships.
