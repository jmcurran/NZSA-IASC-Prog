<span>**Abstract:**</span> We apply the method of active learning to
build a binary classification model for drug consumption data. Due to
the nature of active learning, subject selection is an major issue is
its learning process. There are many kinds of subject selection schemes
proposed in the literature. The subject recruiting procedure may also
depend on its learning target criterion such as accuracy, area under ROC
curve and so on. Moreover, in practical active learning scenarios, the
label information of samples can only be revealed as they are recruited
into training data set, and we will pay the domain experts to label
these selected sample. Therefore, to consider the labelling cost,
how/when to stop an active learning procedure is always an important and
challenging problem in active learning. In this talk, we propose an
active learning procedure targeting at area under an ROC curve, and
based on the idea of robustness, we then used a modified influential
index to locate the most informative samples, sequentially, such that
the learning procedure can achieve the target efficiently. We then apply
our procedure to drug consumption data sets.
