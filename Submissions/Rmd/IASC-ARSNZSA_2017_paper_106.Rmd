<span>**Abstract:**</span> For linear mixed-effects models with data
collected within one cluster, the maximum likelihood estimators of
covariance parameters cannot be estimated consistently. Hence the
asymptotic behaviors of likelihood-based information criteria, such as
Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) are rarely discussed in literature.
In the contrast, the number of the clusters is generally assumed going
to infinity with the sample size to guarantee the consistency of the
covariance parameter estimators and thereby guarantees the consistency
of the model selection procedures. In this talk, under some mild
conditions, we establish asymptotic theorems for ML estimators of
covariance parameters when the number of clusters is fixed. Furthermore,
the asymptotic behaviors of the generalized information criterion, which
includes AIC as special cases, are well studied in our research.
