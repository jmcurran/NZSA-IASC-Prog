ABSTRACT

As big data become more accessible with the boom of data analyzing
software, creating value through analytics has grown in demand. Dealing
with large data sets in anomaly detection problems, accurate tagging of
anomalies is oftentimes lacking and expensive. Unsupervised learning via
clustering analysis can be performed to derive labelled data, but used
alone, is prone to high false alarm rates. We propose a nonparametric
procedure to test presence of clustering effect in a multilevel model
with a large set of predictors. Model estimation is done through
principal component regression (PCR) and two-way analysis-of-variance
(ANOVA), embedded in a backfitting algorithm. Hypothesis test is based
on sieve bootstrap. A simulation study showed that the test is effective
in detecting high clustering effects, and is optimal when sample size
exceeds the number of predictors. The test can be a useful support tool
to help address limitations of existing cluster-based methods in anomaly
detection.
