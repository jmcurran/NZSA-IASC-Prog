<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this talk we investigate the asymptotic
behavior of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient under
the normality assumption and High Dimension Low Sample Size (HDLSS)
settings. In general, canonical correlation matrix is associated with
canonical correlation analysis which is useful in studying the
relationship between two sets of variables. However, in HDLSS settings,
the within-class sample covariance matrix $\hat{\Sigma}$ is singular,
because the rank of $\hat{\Sigma}$ is much less than the number of
dimension. To avoid the singularity of $\hat{\Sigma}$ in HDLSS settings,
we utilize the naive canonical correlation matrix with replacing sample
covariance matrix by its diagonal part only. We derive the asymptotic
normality of the estimated naive canonical correlation coefficient, and
compare the results of our numerical studies to the theoretical
asymptotic results.
