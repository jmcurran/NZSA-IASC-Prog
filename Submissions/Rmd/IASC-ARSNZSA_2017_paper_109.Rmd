Abstract If globalization provides the backdrop for drama, then the
achievements of the garment industry in Bangladesh are indeed dramatic.
The garment industry particularly has played a pioneering role in the
development of industrial sector of Bangladesh and has grown rapidly for
the last 15 years and now one of the largest garment exporters in the
world. The study of our research has examined the successful development
process of the Bangladesh garments industry and explored the keys to its
success. In point of view we collected some primary and secondary data
of garment manufacturers and traders to investigate further the key role
and mechanism of technology transfers to operate a garment industry in
Bangladesh. After that we apply some statistical models such as random
effect model, tobit model and probit model to generate the performance
of our variables. Also we use some dummy variables in case of different
years for all the models. The result of our statistical models indicate
that the high education of manufacturers and enterprise performance are
highly significant. The only reason of this close relationship is that
manufacturers have to upgrade their skills and they know how
continuously in order to survive the intense competition in the world
garment market and the high levels of the general human capital of the
entrepreneur are needed to manage an increasing number of managers and
experts. The result also shows the formal training that the garment
entrepreneur has received in a foreign country and the entrepreneur’s
experience of working at a garments enterprise have small effect on
growth of garment industry but not so much high. This is because those
garment workers who had acquired skills and know-how but they could not
helped smoothly new manufacturers and afford to start trading houses
without good marketing and communication skills. But the traders who
received formal training abroad have provided higher-valued services for
manufacturers and contributed more to the proliferation of
manufacturers. We have also found that foreign owned trading houses
perform better than indigenous trading houses, which suggests that there
still exist skills and know-how to be learned from foreign countries. So
technology transfer seems to be a long-term process and its effect also
seems last over the long term. Finally the key point of our findings
strongly suggest that the performance of manufacturers and traders as
well as production technologies are very potential for the high growth
of industrial development. It has a great opportunity to earn a lot of
foreign currency through developing garment industry and contribute
economic development. Keywords: Bangladesh Garments, Growth of Garment
