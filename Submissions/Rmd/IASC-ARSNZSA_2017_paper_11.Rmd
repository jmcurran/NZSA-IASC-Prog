<span>**Abstract:**</span> Flexi is a statistical program designed to fit variance
based models. In this talk I will explore the advantages and
disadvantages of the variance based model compared to the more commonly
adopted mean based approach. Several examples will be given where the
properties of variance based models provide a clearer understanding of
the data. To illustrate the differences in the approach to the data I
will compare Television and Progressive Graphics File methods of
transferring a picture. The Television builds up the global picture from
individual pixels describing a local area of the picture, whereas the
Progressive Graphics File proceeds from the global value of the median
colour of the whole picture to the local value of each individual pixel
by successive refinements. This gives a coarse blocky picture at the
start which refines into a detailed picture at the end. Mean based
models are like television pictures whereas variance based models are
like Progressive Graphics File pictures. The advantages and
disadvantages of the two methods will be discussed.
