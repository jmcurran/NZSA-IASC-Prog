<span>**Abstract:**</span> The key objective of the Ministry of Justice is to ensure that New
Zealand has a strong justice system that contributes to a safe and just
society. To achieve this objective, the ministry and the wider Justice
Sector need to know whether they are focusing their efforts in the right
places and really making a difference. It is often difficult because we
lack a crucial piece of information: how much crime is actually out
there. Administrative data does not provide an answer as only about 30
The New Zealand Crime and Victims Survey (NZCVS) is introduced to fill
this knowledge gap. The survey which is currently on the pilot phase was
designed to meet the recommendations of Statistics New Zealand and key
stakeholders' demand. It will interview about 8,000 of New Zealand
residents aged from 15 years old and aims to: provide information
about the extent (volumes and prevalence) and nature of crime and
victimisation in New Zealand; provide geographical break-down of
victimisation; provide extensive victims' demographics; measure how
much crime gets reported to Police; understand the experiences of
victims; measure crime trends in New Zealand.

The paper summarises the core requirements to NZCVS obtained from
extended discussions with key stakeholders and describes key design
features to be implemented in order to meet these requirements. These
key requirements include, but are not limited to: Measuring the
extent and nature of reported and unreported crime across New Zealand;
Providing in-depth story-telling of victims' experiences; Providing
frequent and timely information to support Investment Approach for
Justice and wider decision making; Reducing information gaps by
matching the NZCVS with administrative data in Statistics New Zealand's
Integrated Data Infrastructure (IDI).

In particular, the paper discusses modular survey design which includes
core crime and victimisation questions and revolving modules added
annually, stratified random sampling, a new highly automated approach to
offence coding through extended screening, measuring harm from being
victimised, obtaining respondents' informed consent for data matching,
use of survey data for extended analysis and forecasting and other
important survey features.
