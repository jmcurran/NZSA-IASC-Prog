<span>**Abstract:**</span> We introduce some important functions on a
secure computation system and empirically evaluate them using the
statistical computing software R. The secure computation is a
cryptographic technology that enables us to operate data while keeping
the data encrypted. Due to the remarkable aspect, we can construct a
secure on-line analytical system to protect against unauthorized access,
computer virus and internal fraud. Moreover, the function of secure
computation has a benefit for privacy.

So far, we developed a secure computation system that runs R as a
front-end application. In this research, we focus on the analysis of
official microdata using our secure computation system. By employing the
R script language to secure computation, we can potentially make new
functions for the analysis of official microdata on our secure
computation system. We show some examples of functions on the system
using the R script language. A demonstration experiment to verify the
practicality and scalability of the system in the field of official
statistics is also in our scope.
