<span>**Abstract:**</span> Preventing and controlling zoonoses with a
public health policy depends on the knowledge scientists have about the
transmitted pathogens. Modelling jointly the epidemiological data and
genetic information provides a methodology for tracing back the source
of infection. However, this creates difficulties in assessing genetic
efforts behind models of the final statistical inferences due to
increased model complexity. To explore the genetic effects in the joint
model, we develop a genetic free model and compare it to the joint
model. We apply the two models to a recent campylobacteriosis study to
estimate the attribution probability for each source. A spatial
covariate is also considered in the models in order to investigate the
effect of the level of rurality on the source attributions. Comparing
the attributions generated by the two models, we find that: i) the
genetic information integrated in the joint model gives a little more
precise inference to the sparse cases observed in highly rural areas
than the genetic free model; ii) on the logit scale, source attribution
probabilities follow linear trends against level of rurality; and iii)
poultry is the dominant source of campylobacteriosis in urban centres,
whereas ruminants are the most attributable source when in rural areas.
