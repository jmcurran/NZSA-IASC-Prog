<span>**Abstract:**</span> We will discuss in this talk a new
construction for a class of distribution free goodness of fit tests for
the classical problem: testing independence in contingency tables. The
point is that this problem has been stayed with only one asymptotically
distribution free goodness of fit test for a long time, the chi-square
test. We will show that our class of new distribution free goodness of
fit tests is very wide and discuss the cases where the new tests perform
better than the conventional chi-square test.
