<span>**Abstract:**</span> Epidemiologists often wish to determine the population impact of an
intervention to remove or reduce a risk factor. Population attributable
type measures, such as the population attributable risk (PAR) and
population attributable fraction (PAF), provide a means of assessing
this impact, in a way that is accessible for a non-statistical audience.
To apply these concepts to epidemiological data, the calculation of
estimates and confidence intervals for these measures should take into
account the study design (cross-sectional, case-control, survey) and any
sources of uncertainty (such as measurement error in exposure to the
risk factor). We provide methods to produce estimates and Bayesian
credible intervals for the PAR and PAF from common epidemiological study
types and assess the Frequentist properties. The model is then extended
by incorporating uncertainty due to the use of imperfect diagnostic
tests for disease or exposure. The resulting model can be
non-identifiable, causing convergence problems for common MCMC samplers,
such as Gibbs and Metropolis-Hastings. An alternative importance
sampling method performs much better for these non-identifiable models
and can be used to explore the limiting posterior distribution. The data
used to estimate these population attributable measures may include
multiple risk factors in addition to the one being considered for
removal. Uncertainty regarding the distribution of these risk factors in
the population affects the inference for PAR and PAF. To allow for this
we propose a methodology involving the Bayesian bootstrap. We also
extend the analysis to allow for complex survey designs with unequal
weights, stratification and clustering.
