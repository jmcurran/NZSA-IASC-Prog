Epidemiologists often wish to determine the population impact of an
intervention to remove or reduce a risk factor. Population attributable
type measures, such as the population attributable risk (PAR) and
population attributable fraction (PAF), provide a means of assessing
this impact, in a way that is accessible for a non-statistical audience.
To apply these concepts to epidemiological data, the calculation of
estimates and confidence intervals for these measures should take into
account the study design (cross-sectional, case-control, survey) and any
sources of uncertainty (such as measurement error in exposure to the
risk factor).\
We provide methods to produce estimates and Bayesian credible intervals
for the PAR and PAF from common epidemiological study types and assess
the Frequentist properties. The model is then extended by incorporating
uncertainty due to the use of imperfect diagnostic tests for disease or
exposure. The resulting model can be non-identifiable, causing
convergence problems for common MCMC samplers, such as Gibbs and
Metropolis-Hastings. An alternative importance sampling method performs
much better for these non-identifiable models and can be used to explore
the limiting posterior distribution. The data used to estimate these
population attributable measures may include multiple risk factors in
addition to the one being considered for removal. Uncertainty regarding
the distribution of these risk factors in the population affects the
inference for PAR and PAF. To allow for this we propose a methodology
involving the Bayesian bootstrap. We also extend the analysis to allow
for complex survey designs with unequal weights, stratification and
clustering.
