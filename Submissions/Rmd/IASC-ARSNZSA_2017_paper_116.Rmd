<span>**Abstract:**</span> In 2004, Aitken and Lucy published an article detailing a two-level
likelihood ratio for multivariate trace evidence. This model has been
adopted in a number of forensic disciplines such as the interpretation
of glass, drugs (MDMA), and ink. Modern instrumentation is capable of
measuring many elements in very low quantities and, not surprisingly,
forensic scientists wish to exploit the potential of this extra
information to increase the weight of this evidence. The issue, from a
statistical point of view, is that the increase in the number of
variables (dimension) in the problem leads to increased data demand to
understand both the variability within a source, and in between sources.
Such information will come in time, but usually we donâ€™t have enough.
One solution to this problem is to attempt to reduce the dimensionality
through methods such as principal component analysis. This practice is
quite common in high dimensional machine learning problems. In this
talk, I will describe a study where we attempt to quantify the effects
of this this approach on the resulting likelihood ratios using data
obtained from SEM-EDX instrument.
