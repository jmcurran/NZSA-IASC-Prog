Robust statistics are often computed when outliers are present. One of
the diagnostics tools for assessing the robustness of estimation is the
influence function, which measures the impact on a statistic of adding
new data to or removing existing data from the data set. It is also
useful for computing the standard error of the statistic.

The computation of influence function for closed form estimates is
relatively easy in comparison to that for non-closed form estimates.
However, robust statistics are often not in closed form and are computed
using iterative algorithms. Obtaining the analytical form of the
empirical influence functions of robust statistics for multiple
parameters is rare in the current literature and not easy.

In this talk, I use matrix algebra including matrix derivation to show
how influence functions for robust statistics can be obtained
analytically, particularly in M-estimators with multiple of parameter
vectors.
