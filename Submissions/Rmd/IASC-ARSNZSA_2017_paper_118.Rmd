<span>**Abstract:**</span> This study investigated the outcomes of a brief telephone intervention
for problem gambling. A total of 150 callers were recruited and followed
for 36 months. After giving consent, participants received a baseline
assessment followed by a manualised version of the helpline’s standard
care. Eight-six percent of participants were re-assessed at three
months, 79Depression is found to often be associated with problem
gambling behaviour, and analysis was undertaken to examine the impact of
a brief telephone intervention for problem gambling on rates of
depression using logistic regression. At baseline depression was found
to be associated with gender, problem gambling risk (PGSI), and
deprivation (NZiDep). A multiple variable model found that PGSI and
mental health medication best explained depression at baseline. A
repeated measures logistic regression utilising all 36 months of data
found that PGSI, NZiDep, and mental health medication were the best
variables to explain the change over time. Conclusion was that the
intervention’s impact on problem gambling behaviour also changed
depression rates, however deprivation and mental health medication also
contributed.
