<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper describes a `frame_calendar`
function that organises and displays temporal data, collected on
sub-daily resolution, into a calendar layout. Calendars are broadly used
in society to display temporal information, and events. The
`frame_calendar` uses linear algebra on the date variable to create the
layout. It utilises the grammar of graphics to create the plots inside
each cell, and thus synchronises neatly with <span>**ggplot2**</span>
graphics. The motivating application is studying pedestrian behaviour in
Melbourne, Australia, based on counts which are captured at hourly
intervals by sensors scattered around the city. Faceting by the usual
features such as day and month, was insufficient to examine the
behaviour. Making displays on a monthly calendar format helps to
understand pedestrian patterns relative to events such as work days,
weekends, holidays, and special events. The layout algorithm has several
format options and variations. It is implemented in the R package
<span>**sugrrants**</span>.
