<span>**Abstract:**</span> For the purpose of feature selection in
ultra-high dimensional regression models, it is required that a sequence
of candidate models and a criterion to select the “best” model from them
are available. Under different scenarios, various methods have been
proposed to achieve these two goals. Intuitively, it is straightforward
to choose appropriate loss and penalty functions in a regularization
method to accommodate specific characteristics of the data. However, the
computation could be expensive for certain cases. From recent studies,
we can see that sequential method is promising to produce good candidate
models for ultra-high dimensional data. Moreover, it can be easily
extended to complex models other than the linear regression model. In
this paper, we propose a new feature selection method based on robust
estimation.
