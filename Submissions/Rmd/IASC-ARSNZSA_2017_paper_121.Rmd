<span>**Abstract**</span>. We consider feature selection in multivariate
regression models where the response variables as well as the covariates
are high-dimensional and both have intrinsic group structures. The
models arise naturally in many biology studies for detecting
associations between multiple traits and multiple features where the
traits and features are embedded in biological functioning groups such
as genes or pathways. We propose a sequential procedure for selecting
the feature groups based on a correlation principle. At each step of the
procedure, the response groups are fitted to already selected feature
groups and the residuals are obtained for the response groups, then, the
feature group which has the highest correlation with the residuals of
any response group is selected next. The correlation measure is the
trace of the sample canonical correlation matrix between two vectors.
The EBIC is used as the stopping rule of the procedure. This procedure
possesses the property of selection consistency. Compared with a group
penalization approach, our method is more accurate and demands much less
computation.
