<span>**Abstract:**</span> Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggests that a complex phenotype is often affected by many variants with small effects, known as "polygenicity". Tens of thousands of samples are often required to ensure statistical power of identifying these variants with small effects. In this study, we propose a statistical approach, IGESS, to increasing statistical power of identifying risk variants and improving accuracy of risk prediction by integrating individual level genotype data and summary statistics. An efficient algorithm based on variational inference is developed to handle genome-wide-scale analysis. Through comprehensive simulation studies, we demonstrated the advantages of IGESS over the methods which take either individual level data or summary statistics data as input. We applied IGESS to perform integrative analysis of Crohn's Disease from WTCCC and summary statistics from other studies. IGESS was able to significantly increase statistical power of identifying risk variants and improve risk prediction accuracy.
