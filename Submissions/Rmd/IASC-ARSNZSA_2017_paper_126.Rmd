<span>**Abstract**</span>. The Nested Sampling algorithm, invented in
the mid-2000s by John Skilling, represented a major advance in Bayesian
computation. Whereas Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are usually
effective for sampling posterior distributions, Nested Sampling also
calculates the marginal likelihood integral used for model comparison,
which is a computationally demanding task. However, there are other
kinds of integrals that we might want to compute. Specifically, the
entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, which quantify
uncertainty and relevance, are all integrals whose form is inconvenient
in most practical applications. I will present my technique, based on
Nested Sampling, for estimating these quantities for probability
distributions that are only accessible via MCMC sampling. This includes
posterior distributions, marginal distributions, and distributions of
derived quantities. I will present an example from experimental design,
where one wants to optimise the relevance of the data for inference of a
parameter.
