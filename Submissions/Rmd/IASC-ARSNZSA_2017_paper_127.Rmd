<span>**Abstract:**</span> Missing data in Randomised Control Trials is usually
unavoidable, but can present considerable issues to analysis in an
Intention-to-Treat (ITT) setting. Multiple imputation is often regarded
as the most appropriate method of handling missing data when compared
with simpler methods such as complete case analysis and mean/mode
imputation. However, in practice it can often be tricky to implement
when working with large longitudinal datasets. The Sodium Lowering in
Dialysate (SOLID) trial is a randomised control trial seeking to improve
cardiovascular and other outcomes by lowering the dialysate
concentration of sodium of patients on home haemodialysis. The trial
contains 99 participants and over 30 primary and secondary outcomes.
Missing data from various sources are present at baseline and at
follow-up time points. Attempting to multiply impute a large number of
outcomes, each measured at up to 4 follow-up times, proved to be a
challenging task in this study. Several attempts to obtain sensible
imputations were made but many of these failed due to the presence of
highly correlated outcomes which were often missing together. This
presentation discusses the approach taken to overcome this problem,
which involved defining sets of outcomes to impute in various rounds,
preventing sets of similar (highly correlated, missing together)
outcomes being imputed in the same round. Once a round of imputation was
completed, the next set of outcomes to be imputed was matched onto the
completed dataset. This process is repeated until the full ITT dataset
contains no missing values in any outcomes. We call this “stepped
imputation”. Theory from mixed models was also applied to seek measures
associated with the missingness mechanism, with the potential to include
them in the final model to further reduce any possible bias resulting
from missing data. Results from a simulation to test the validity of
“stepped imputation” will be presented. In this simulation, an attempt
is made to generate data related in a similar way to the outcomes in the
SOLID trial. Results from the “gold standard” analysis with no missing
data, and the complete case analysis is compared to the stepped
imputation method.
