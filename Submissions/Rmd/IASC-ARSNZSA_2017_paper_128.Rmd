<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, we propose a new framework to
extract a complete list of the articles written by researchers who
belong to a specific research or educational institute from an academic
document database such as Web of Science and Scopus. In this framework,
it is necessary to perform author name identification because the query
for the database is based on the author’s name to extract documents
written before the author comming to the current institute. The
framework is based on the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA), which is a
kind of topic modeling, and some techniques and indices such as synonym
retrieval and inverse document frequency (IDF) are used for enhancing
the framework.
