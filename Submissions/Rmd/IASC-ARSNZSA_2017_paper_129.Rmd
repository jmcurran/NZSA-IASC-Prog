<span>**Abstract:**</span> Symmetry and asymmetry models are used to
analyze a <span>*square*</span> contingency table with ordinal
categories. Caussinus (1966) pointed out that the symmetry model, which
indicates the structure of symmetry for cell probabilities, could be
separated into the structure of symmetry for odds-ratios and that of
symmetry for marginal distributions. This result provides the reason for
poor fit of the symmetry model when it occurs for a real dataset. Also,
other separations of the symmetry model have been given. For example,
Kateri and Agresti (2007), and Saigusa et al. (2015). In this paper, we
consider the separation of symmetry by using the generalized asymmetry
models. A theorem which the likelihood ratio statistic for testing
goodness of fit of the symmetry model is asymptotically equivalent to
the sum of those for testing the generalized asymmetry model and the
moment equality model under some conditions is given. A simulation study
is presented.
