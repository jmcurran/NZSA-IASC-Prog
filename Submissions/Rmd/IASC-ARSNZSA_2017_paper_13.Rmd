<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this work we consider a two-parameter distribution with bathtub shape
under progressive first failure censoring. We obtain maximum likelihood
estimates of unknown parameters and then compute observed Fisher
information matrix. Further we consider a non linear regression model to
estimate the unknown parameters using least square estimation method and
construct 95% Bonferroni confidence intervals for the same. We also
estimate the parameters using Bayesian approaches such as Tierney-Kadane
method and Metropolis-Hastings algorithm against gamma prior
distributions. One- and two-sample prediction problems are discussed
under Bayesian framework. We study the performance of proposed methods
using Monte Carlo Simulations and finally analyze a real data set for
illustration purposes.
