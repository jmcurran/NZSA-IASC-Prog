<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper presents a new transformation
technique for multiscale visualization of one-dimensional data such as
time series and functional data under the concept of the scale-space
approach. The proposed method uses a range of regular observations (eye
scanning) with varying intervals. The results, termed ‘elastic-band
transform’ can be considered as a collection of observations over
different intervals of viewing. It is motivated by a way that human
looks at an object such as a sequence of data repeatedly in order to
overview a global structure of it as well as find some specific features
of it. Some measures based on elastic-bands are discussed for describing
characteristics of data, and two-dimensional visualizations induced by
the measures are developed for understanding and detecting important
structures of data. Furthermore, some statistical applications are
studied.
