<span>**Abstract:**</span> Building a predictive model of crime with
good predictive accuracy has a great value in enabling efficient use of
policing resources and reduction in crime. Building such models is not
straightforward though due to the dynamic nature of the crime process.
The crime not only evolves over both space and time, but is also related
to several complex socio-economic factors, not all of which can be
measured directly and accurately. The last decade or more has seen a
surge in the effort to model crime more accurately. Many of the models
developed so far have failed to capture the crime with a great degree of
accuracy. The main reasons could be that all these models discretise the
space using grid cells and that they are spatial, not spatio-temporal.
We fit a log Gaussian Cox process model using the INLA-SPDE approach.
This not only allows us to capture crime as a process continuous in both
space and time, but also allows us to include socio-economic factors as
well as the ’near repeat’ phenomenon. In this talk, we will discuss the
model building process and the accuracy achieved.
