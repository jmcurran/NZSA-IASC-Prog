<span>**Abstract:**</span> Over the last two decades generalized
additive models (GAMs) have become an indispensible tool for modern data
analysis and regression. First-generation GAMs as developed by Hastie
and Tibshirani are based on backfitting (e.g., the `gam` R package).
Second-generation GAMs have automatic smoothing parameter selection
(e.g., the `mgcv` package by Simon Wood) and are based on, e.g.,
P-splines. Until recently, these two implementations were largely
confined to the exponential family. However, since the 1990s, the vector
generalized linear and additive model (VGLM/VGAM) classes were developed
by Yee and coworkers, and these are a much larger class of models.
First-generation VGAMs were based on vector splines and vector
backfitting. This talk will describe 2nd-generation VGAMs using
O-splines and P-splines. We illustrate them by examples, to show that
automatic smoothing parameter selection based on optimizing a predictive
quantity such as generalized cross validation can be very useful. The
speakerâ€™s `VGAM` package implementation will be described.
