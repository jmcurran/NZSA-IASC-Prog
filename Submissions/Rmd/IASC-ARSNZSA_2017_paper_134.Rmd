<span>**Abstract**</span>. Prediction and classification challenges have
become an exciting and useful feature of the statistical and machine
learning community. For example, Good Judgement Open asks forecasters to
predict the probability of particular world events, and Kaggle.com
regularly sets classification challenges. Challenge organizers typically
publish a ranked list of the leading submissions and, ultimately,
announce the winner of the challenge. However, in order for such a
competition to be considered worth entering, the challenge organizers
must be seen to evaluate the submissions in a fair and open manner.
Scoring rules were devised precisely to solve this problem. Crucially,
<span>*proper*</span> scoring rules elicit honest statements of belief
about the outcome. If the challenge organizers use a proper scoring rule
to evaluate submissions, a competitor’s expected score under their true
belief will be optimized by actually quoting that belief to the
organizers. A proper scoring rule therefore rules out any possibility of
a competitor gaming the challenge. We discuss a class of proper scoring
rules called linear scoring rules that are specifically adapted to
probabilistic binary classification. When applied in competition
situations, we show that all linear scoring rules essentially balance
the needs of organizers and competitors. We also develop scoring rules
to score a sequence of predictions that are targeting a single outcome.
These scoring rules discount predictions over time and appropriately
weight prediction updates.
