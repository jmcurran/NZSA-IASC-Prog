In livestock, a primary goal is the identification of individuals’
breeding values - a measure of their genetic worth. This identification
can be used to aid with selective breeding, but is non trivial due to
how large data can be.

Measured traits are typically modelled as being caused by both breeding
values and also environmental fixed effects. An efficient method for
fitting this model was developed by Henderson (1984), based upon
generalized least squares. This method could be applied to data where
the pedigree - how each animal was related to one another - was fully
known.

Improvements in technology have allowed the genetic information of an
animal to be directly measured. These measurements can be taken very
early in life, with the goal of informing selective breeding faster and
more efficiently. Meuwissen (2001) adapted the standard model to
incorporate genetic data, and additionally developed multiple fitting
methods for this model.

Modern datasets are frequently only partially genotyped. The methods of
Meuwissen cannot be used for these data, as they are only applicable to
populations in which every individual is gentoyped. Modern fitting
approaches aim to make use of the available genetic information without
requiring all individuals be genotyped.

These approaches tend to either impute or average over missing genotype
data, which can affect the overall accuracy of breeding value
estimation. We are developing an alternative which instead incorporates
missing data within the model, rather than having to adapt fitting
approaches to accommodate it.

Preliminary results suggest that approaching fitting is this way can
lead to improved accuracy of estimation in certain situations.
