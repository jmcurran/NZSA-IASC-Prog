<span>**Abstract:**</span> Correspondence analysis (CA) is well known to be a member of the family
of multivariate analysis techniques and is concerned with the
visualisation of the association between two or more categorical
variables. The classic texts of Greenacre (1984) and Lebart, Morineau
and Warwick (1984), for example, provide an excellent technical,
practical and historical account of development of CA up to that period.
What is less well known is that the literature on CA extends well beyond
the traditional approaches that can be found in many multivariate texts
and often there are disciplines that redefine the way in which it is
performed. For example, the various fields of ecology have successfully
germinated variants including <span>*canonical correspondence
analysis*</span> and <span>*detrended correspondence analysis*</span>.
However the scope, and literature, of CA is not confined to these
examples. Beh and Lombardo (2014, Section 1.6.3) and provide a
comprehensive list of members of the “family” which, now, number about
50 members. I shall provide an overview of some of the popular, and
not-so-popular, members of the CA family.
