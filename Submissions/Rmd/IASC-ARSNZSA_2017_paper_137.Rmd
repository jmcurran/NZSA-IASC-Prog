<span>**Abstract**</span>. We present the initial results from a project
looking at the linguistic and socio-linguistic characteristics that
affect the prevalence of Māori loanwords in the use of New Zealand
English, and describe the paths we see this research taking in the next
few years.

Loanwords are words that originate in one language (the donor language)
and enter into, and are productively used within another language (the
host language). For our initial research, we were particularly
interested in the use of Māori loanwords in spoken New Zealand English,
as found within the Wellington Corpus of Spoken New Zealand English.

We used generalised linear mixed effects models to determine if there
were significant relationships between the linguistic characteristics of
the loanwords used / words replaced, demographic features of the
speakers, and the ethnicity of the audiences.

We found that linguistic characteristics of the loanwords and their
English counterparts affect the probability of using the loanword for
both Pākehā and Māori speakers, there was a difference in the
probability of using a loanword between the sexes for Māori speakers
only, and Māori speakers moderated the use of loanwords in conversations
depending on the ethnicity of their audience.

We will briefly describe the next phase of the research that will use
network modelling to characterise the use of Māori loanwords in written
media.
