<span>**Abstract:**</span> Ecological managers often require knowledge
about species distributions across a spatial region in order to
facilitate best management practices. Statistical models are frequently
used to infer relationships between species observations (eg. presence,
abundance, biomass, etc.) and environmental covariates in order to
predict values at unobserved locations. Issues remain for situations
where covariate information is not available for a predictive location.
In these cases, spatial maps of covariates are often generated using
tools such as kriging; however, the uncertainties from this statistical
estimation are not carried through to the final species distribution
map. New advances in spatial modelling using the automated
differentiation software, Template Model Builder, allow both the spatial
process of the environmental covariates and the observations to be
modelled simultaneously by maximizing the marginal likelihood of the
fixed effects with a Laplace approximation after integrating out the
random spatial effects. This method allows for the uncertainty of the
covariate estimation process to be included in the standard errors of
final predictions as well as any derived quantities, such as total
biomass for a spatial region. We intend to demonstrate this method and
compare our predictions to those from a model where regional covariate
information is supplied from a kriging model.
