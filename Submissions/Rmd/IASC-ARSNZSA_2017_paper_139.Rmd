<span>**Abstract:**</span> Rubin causal model is a statistical model to
estimate the effect of a treatment on the outcome based on the framework
of potential outcomes. To estimate a causal effect based on Rubin causal
model, propensity score plays a central role. In particular, matching
and weighting methods like Inverse Probability Weighted Estimator (IPWE)
and Doubly-Robust estimator based on the estimated propensity score are
widely used. Despite its popularity, it was pointed out that model
misspecification of the propensity score can result in substantial bias
of the resulting estimators of a causal effect and potential outcomes.
It is possible to estimate propensity score in nonparametric ways or
machine learning methods to avoid model misspecification. However, it
doesn’t work well in most situations due to following reasons: 1) Curse
of dimensionality. 2) They only aim at an accuracy of classification and
don’t optimize the covariate balancing. To overcome the problems above,
we propose a new estimator of propensity score using kernel mean
embeddings of conditional distributions. Although our proposal is
completely nonparametric, our estimator has a dimensionality-independent
rate of convergence. Using kernel measures of conditional independence
for model selection, our estimator can also correct the bias that arises
from the imbalance of covariates. In numerical simulations, we confirm
that our method can reduce the bias in misspecified settings. We also
describe several asymptotic properties of our estimator.
