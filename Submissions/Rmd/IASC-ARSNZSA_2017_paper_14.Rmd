<span>**Abstract:**</span> This work considers determination of optimum
warranty length under Type-II unified hybrid censoring scheme. Consumers
are willing to purchase a highly reliable product with certain cost
constraint. To assure the product reliability and also to remain
profitable, the manufacturer provides warranties on product lifetime.
Moreover, censoredlifetime data are available in practice, to assess the
reliability of the product. Therefore, determination of an appropriate
warranty length based on censored lifetime data is an important issue to
the manufacturer. It is assumed that the lifetime follows a lognormal
distribution. We consider a combine free replacement and pro-rata
warranty policy (FRW/PRW). The life test is conducted under Type-II
unified hybrid censoring scheme. The warranty length is obtained by
maximizing an expected utility function.The expectation is taken with
respect to the posterior predictive model for time to failure given the
available data obtained under Type-II unified hybrid censoring scheme. A
real data set is analyzed to illustrate the proposed methodology. We
propose a non-linear prorate warranty policy and compare them with
linear warranty policy. It is observed that non-linear prorate warranty
policy give larger warranty length with maximum profit
