Title: R in Industry-Application on Pipe Renewal Planning Speaker: Glenn
Thomas, Data Scientist, Harmonic Analytics

R has become an increasingly used tool in industry to practically help
councils and organisations with their asset management challenges. We
will demonstrate some of the practical tools Harmonic Analytics has
developed using R to assist in asset management.

One specific example demonstrated will be recent work for a New Zealand
council that was experiencing challenges in long term planning around
its three waters infrastructure. In particular, challenges stem from the
limited information about pipe condition. Using past work order history
as proxy for pipe failures, we present a tool that uses a pipe break
model to inform replacement strategies. The developed tool allows users
to generate and compare both data driven and engineering based scenarios
through a variety of lenses, ranging from annual replacement length to
service level outcomes. A number of visualisations are available to
support comparisons. Data driven scenarios are driven from a variety of
perspectives, such as traditional age based replacement, probability of
failure and minimising the expected number of pipe breaks across the
network.

This kind of work is an exciting step forward, as councils show interest
in collaboration and pooling data to improve accuracy.
