<span>**Abstract:**</span> Distributed Computing Systems such as Hadoop
and Spark allow statistical analysis to be performed on arbitrary large
datasets. However, when performing statistical analysis on these
systems, the data communication between the nodes of a distributed
computing system can become a major performance bottleneck. In this
work, we outline a novel combination of statistical and computation
techniques to address this issue. We first apply data reduction
technique such as coarsening (interval-censoring) on large data sets
using a distributed computing system. We then perform statistical
analysis on the coarsened data. However, performing analysis using
coarsened data potentially introduces biases in the results. To address
this, we use the Expectation-Maximisation (EM) algorithm to recover the
complete (non-coarsened) data model. Our work draws on methods for the
analysis of data involving coarsened co-variates using EM by methods of
weights. We explore different coarsening strategies (e.g., rounding,
quantile and quintile) and discuss how our methods can scale to very
large data settings. Through simulation studies, we find our method
works especially well when data is coarsened from a wide interval, where
there are more loss of information. Compared with na√Øvely using the
coarsened data, our method is able to estimate regression coefficients
that are closer to estimates obtained from using the complete data. In
addition, the standard errors from our method reflect more accurately
the uncertainty arising from using coarsened data.
