**Abstract**

Complex multiple seasonality is an important emerging challenge in time
series forecasting. We propose a framework that segregates the task into
two stages. In the first stage, the time series is aggregated at the low
frequency level (such as daily or weekly) and suitable methods such as
regression, ARIMA or TBATS, are used to fit this lower frequency data.
In the second stage, additive or multiplicative seasonality at the
higher frequency levels may be estimated using classical, or
function-based methods. Finally, the estimates from the two stages are
combined.

In this work, we build a package for implementing the above two-stage
framework for modeling time series with multiple levels of seasonality
within R. This would make it convenient to execute and possibly lead to
more practitioners and academicians adopting it. The package would allow
the user to decide the specific methods to be used in the two stages and
also the separation between high and low frequency. Errors are
calculated for both model and validation period, which may be selected
by the user and model selection choices based on different criterion
will be facilitated. Forecast combination may also be integrated with
the developed routine. The schematics will be presented along with
demonstration of the package in several real data sets.

Keywords: Additive seasonality, ARIMA, forecast combination, high
frequency, low frequency, multiplicative seasonality, polynomial
seasonality, regression, TBATS, trigonometric seasonality.
