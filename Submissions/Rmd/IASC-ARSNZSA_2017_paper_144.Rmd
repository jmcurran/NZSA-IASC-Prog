<span>**Abstract:**</span> Spatial scan statistics are widely used for
cluster detection analysis in geographical disease surveillance. While
the method has been developed for various types of data such as binary,
count and continuous data, spatial scan statistics for matched
case-control data, which often arise in spatial epidemiology, have not
been considered yet. In this paper, we propose two spatial scan
statistics for matched case-control data. The proposed test statistics
properly consider the correlations between matched pairs. We evaluate
statistical power and cluster detection accuracy of the proposed methods
through simulations comparing with the Bernoulli-based method. We
illustrate the methods with the use of a real data example.
