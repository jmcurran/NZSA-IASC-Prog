<span>**Abstract**</span>. A novel model-based clustering procedure for
multivariate categorical data is proposed. The proposed model assumes
that each response probability has a low-dimensional representation of
the cluster structure, which is constructed by weights for categorical
variables and scores for cluster representatives. For the visualization
of the cluster structure, we define low-dimensional scores for
individuals as convex combinations of scores for cluster
representatives, which may be interpretable in a similar manner to the
archetypal analysis developed by Cutler and Breiman (1994). Because the
proposed model has the so-called rotational indeterminacy, it is needed
to conduct rotation methods after parameter estimation to obtain
interpretable results. Instead of this two-step approach, we develop a
penalized likelihood procedure that imposes a sparsity-inducing penalty
on the weights for categorical variables. To optimize the proposed
penalized likelihood criterion, we develop an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm with gradient projection and coordinate descent. It is
shown that there is trade-off relation between the convergence rate of
the algorithm and the cluster recovery.
