<span>**Abstract:**</span> For some scientists, seeing a statistician in the corridor is the
equivalent of coming face to face with the grim reaper. They fear being
beaten over the head with a Stat101 textbook as you try to hammer into
them the importance of replication, randomisation or an appropriate
sample size. Many scientists would rather blunder through on their own
than admit to the statistician that they don’t understand the
ins-and-outs of ANOVA. So we end up with peer reviewed research with
badly interpreted p-values and underwhelming Excel graphs despite the
existence of more elegant solutions. As ambassadors of statistical
rigour, we are the ones who can turn this around. When the scientists
won’t come to us, how can we improve data usage short of chasing
scientists down corridors with textbooks? I will give examples of how to
Talk Data with scientists to encourage their statistical awakening. In
the right context, even the most puritanical scientists can become more
comfortable Talking Data. They may even find they enjoy it!
