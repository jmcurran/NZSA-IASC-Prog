<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this work, we manipulate financial big
data of world-wide companies by R packages SparkR and sparklyr, and
treate data visualization (e.g. Ihaka, 2017; Unwin, 2015) and
statistical model (e.g. Chambers and Hastie, 1991) based on exploratory
data analysis (Tukey, 1977) with R. The dataset is extracted from the
database systems by Bureau van Dijk KK which contains information on
over 80,000 listed companies. We find that a log-skew-t linear model
(e.g. Azallini and Capitanio, 2014) is very useful for explaining sales
by employees and assets.
