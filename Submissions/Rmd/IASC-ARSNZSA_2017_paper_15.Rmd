<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, a model-adaptive test
statistic is proposed to do model checking for functional single-index
models. Dimension reduction methods are included to handle the curse of
dimensionality. The test statistic consists of two parts: the first term
is a naive one, and the second term is adaptive to the model as if the
model were univariate. It is consistent and can detect local alternative
at a fast rate. Monte Carlo method is used to find the critical value
under null hypothesis. Simulation studies show the performance of our
proposed test procedure.
