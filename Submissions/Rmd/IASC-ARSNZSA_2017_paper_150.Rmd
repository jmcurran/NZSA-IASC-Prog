<span>**Abstract**</span>. The importance of systems enabling us to
extract useful information from enormous text data produced every day
along with our social activities in organizations or on the internet and
utilize the information immediately and efficiently have been
increasing. In this research, an analyzing method which extracts
essential parts from a huge document set utilizing association rule
analysis as a data mining method is introduced. The method detects
typical combinations of terms involved in contexts and regards them as
the characterization of text data and it is also combined with
information retrieval methods for the sake of further selection as some
parts of the essential contexts. This method is considered to enhance
its ability of detection for particular contexts that contain some
topics and include moderately distributed terminologies. And
implementation of the system is discussed in order for utilizing the
abstracted documents efficiently as some sort of knowledge such as
collective intelligence. An approach for linkage with R is also
mentioned in the phase of the implementation of the model.
