In this paper we propose a bi-level variable selection approach, Bivas,
for linear regression under the Bayesian framework. This model assumes
that each variable is assigned to a pre-specified group where only a
subset of the groups truly contribute to the response variable. Besides,
within the active groups, there are only a small number of variables are
important. A hierarchical formulation is adopted to mimic this pattern,
where the spike-slab prior is put on both individual variable level and
group level. A computationally efficient algorithm is developed using
variational inference. Both simulation studies and real examples are
analyzed, through which we illustrate the advantages of our method for
both variable selection and parameter estimation under certain
conditions.
