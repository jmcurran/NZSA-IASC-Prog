<span>**Abstract:**</span> Large-scale integrated cancer genome and
proteome characterization efforts including the cancer genome atlas and
clinical proteomic tumor analysis consortium have opened unprecedented
opportunities to reveal the comprehensive understandings of cancer
biology. An important challenge is organizing our knowledge how the
genomic events drive the proteome and phosphoproteome to form phenotypic
characteristics.

However, connecting the genome and the proteome is not straightforward
since measuring technologies for the genome and the proteome are quite
different and thus the coverage that can be measured is different.
Besides, the proteome data usually include massive amount of missing
values. These issues include several statistical problems - massive
missing data imputation, statistical models to connect the distinct
datasets from different measurement technologies, and interpretable
statistical models that can explain clinical outcomes.

Currently, we are developing proteogenomic data analysis approaches
including the systematic workflow (pipeline) for the cancer protegenomic
clinical data. We will present the progression of our current work as
well as discussing the statistical approaches, using actual ongoing
clinical dataset.
