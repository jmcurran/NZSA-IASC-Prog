<span>**Abstract:**</span> Multivariate regression aims at the study of
the relationship between one set of input variables X and one set of
output variables Y. Challenges occur when no parametric model is known
and yet the number of variables is large. To overcome the difficulties,
dimension reduction methods under the inverse regression viewpoint have
been investigated by many authors. Liquid association (LA) depicts the
change in the covariation of two variables X and Y as a third variable Z
varies. In this talk, I will describe a framework to illustrate how the
LA methodology can help increase the modeling flexibility of
multivariate regression in analyzing complex data.
