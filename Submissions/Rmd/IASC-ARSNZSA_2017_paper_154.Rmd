<span>**Abstract:**</span> Two types of models are considered and compared. The first is a generalized linear model with logit link, with quasibinomial error, and with weighting function that is designed to give reduced weights at the two ends of the scale, relative to mortalities of around 50%. The other approach is to apply a logit transform, and then use a linear model. The logit transformed data appears, for the data that motivated this paper, consistent with the usual linear model variance homogeneity assumptions. For use of a generalized linear model, the standard linear model diagnostics require modifica- tion so that high mortality points do not unduly distort the smooth that is standardly shown for the scale-location plot. A further issue is that 100% mortality points appear to distort a response that, for mortalities less than 100%, is close to linear on the scale of the link function.
