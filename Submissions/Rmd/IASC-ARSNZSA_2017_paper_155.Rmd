<span>**Abstract:**</span> Copy number variations (CNVs) are genomic
structural mutations with abnormal gene fragment copies. Current CNV
detection algorithms for next generation sequencing (NGS) are developed
for specific genome targets, including whole genome sequencing and
targeted exome sequencing based on the differently data types and
corresponding assumptions. Many whole genome tools assume the continuity
of search space and reads uniform coverage across the genome. However,
these assumptions break down in the exome capture because of
discontinuous segments and exome specific functional biases. In order to
develop a method adapting to both data types, we specify the large
unconsidered genomic fragments as gaps to preserve the truly location
information. A Bayesian hierarchical model was built and an efficient
reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo inference algorithm was
utilized to incorporate the gap information. The performance of gap
settings for the Bayesian procedure was evaluated and compared with
competing approaches using both simulations and real data.
