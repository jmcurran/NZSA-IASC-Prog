Modelling the distribution of lifetime using compound time-homogenous
Poisson process

Kien Trung Tran Victoria University of Wellington

Modelling the distribution of lifetime has traditionally been done by
constructing a deterministic function for the survival function and/or
force of mortality. This paper outlines previous research and presents
the author's initial attempts to model the force of mortality and
remaining lifetime using time-homogenous compound Poisson processes.

The paper presents two models. In model 1, the force of mortality of an
individual is modelled as a random sum of i.i.d random variables (i.e. a
compound Poisson process). In model 2, each individual is assumed to
have an initial normally distributed innate lifetime, and their
remaining life is a shifted compound Poisson process. In other words, we
assume that there are random events coming at a constant rate modifying
either the force of mortality or remaining lifetime of individuals.
Simulations in R are then run to find the optimized parameters and the
empirical survival function, force of mortality and distribution of
lifetime are then constructed. Finally, these outputs are compared
existing models and actual demographic data.

It turns out that for model 1, it is very difficult to model the force
of mortality using a time-homogenous compound Poisson process without
introducing additional complications such as the inclusion of event
times. For model 2, however, if we allow the events to be a Cauchy
random variable, then we can model the survival function of New Zealand
population much better than several existing well-known specifications
such as Weibull.
