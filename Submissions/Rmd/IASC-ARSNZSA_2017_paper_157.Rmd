<span>**Abstract**</span>. Time series forecasting is a decade-long
research and which is being evolving day by day. Due to the recent
advancement is deep learning technique many of the complex problems have
been solved using deep learning. Deep learning techniques have shown
tremendous better performance in supervised learning problem. One of the
reasons for this success is the ability of deep feedforward network
methods to learn multiple feature interaction for a single instance.
However, the time-dependent nature not being captured by deep
feedforward network till the evolution of RNN(recurrent neural network)
and LSTM(long short term memory) network architecture. This paper
reveals the success of LSTM time series in comparison with ARIMA and
other standard approaches for time series modeling. A sensitivity
analysis is also conducted to explore the effect of hyper parameter
tuning on LSTM model to reduce the time series forecasting error. We
also derive practical advice from our empirical results for those
interested in getting most out of LSTM time series for modern time
series forecasting.
