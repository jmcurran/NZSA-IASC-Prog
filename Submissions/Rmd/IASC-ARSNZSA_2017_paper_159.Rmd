<span>**Abstract:**</span> Innovation is the act of creating new value
by using “new connection”, “new point of view”, “new way of thinking”,
“new usage method” (Schumpeter 1912). In recent years, the promotion of
the Innovation has been strongly encouraged. In the field of research,
attempts are also being made to create new value through connection
between those fields. Moreover, along with the move to promote
integration among these research fields, research is being conducted to
grasp and promote the degree of them. In this research, for the purpose
of providing indices for measuring the degree of them, we show indices
quantitatively indicating the degree of fusion in different fields and
the distance between the fields. Also, we have try to present indices
for grasping the whole image based on the random graph.
