<span>**Abstract**</span>. In this talk, we propose an EWMA chart for
monitoring covariance matrix based on the dissimilarity index of two
matrices. It is different from the conventional EWMA charts for
monitoring covariance matrix which are either based on comparing the sum
or product or both of the eigenvalues of the estimated EWMA covariance
matrix with those of the IC covariance matrix. The proposed chart
essentially monitors covariance matrix by comparing the individual
eigenvalues of the estimated EWMA covariance matrix with those of the
estimated covariance matrix from the IC phase I data. We evaluate the
performance of the proposed chart by comparing it with the best existing
chart under the multivariate normal process. Furthermore, to prevent the
control limit of the proposed EMMA chart using the limited IC phase I
data from having extensively excessive false alarms, we use a bootstrap
method to adjust the control limit to guarantee that the proposed chart
has the actual IC average run length not less than the nominal one with
a certain probability. Finally, we use an example to demonstrate the
applicability and implementation of the proposed chart.
