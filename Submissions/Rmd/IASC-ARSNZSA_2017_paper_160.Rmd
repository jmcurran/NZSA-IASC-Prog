<span>**Abstract:**</span> Analysis of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation is a
remarkable research area in cosmology whose results won two Nobel prizes
in physics in 1978 and 2006 for the discovery of the CMB radiation and
its anisotropy. Spurred on by a wealth of satellite data, intensive
investigations in the past few years have resulted in many relevant
physical and mathematical formalisms to describe and characterise CMB
radiation. At the same time, these investigations have raised a number
of challenges, theoretical and practical. Studies of deviations from
isotropy and Gaussianity, the two fundamental assumptions of
cosmological models of the early Universe, form the core of recent
experimental and theoretical research in cosmology.

Recent results on modelling CMB evolution and approximation of
corresponding random fields will be discussed. Some new approaches to
test Gaussianity using multifractality will be illustrated using CMB
data. Finally, a new R package for CMB data will be presented.

The presentation is based on joint research with Vo Anh (QUT),
N.Leonenko (Cardiff university), P.Broadbridge, D. Fryer, Yu.G. Wang (La
Trobe University). This research was supported under the Australian
Research Councilâ€™s Discovery Project DP160101366.
