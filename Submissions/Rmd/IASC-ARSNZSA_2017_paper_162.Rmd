<span>**Abstract:**</span> Data formed from record-linkage of two or
more datasets are an increasingly important source of data for public
health and social science research. For example, a study cohort may be
linked to administrative data in order to add outcome or covariate
information to data collected directly from study participants. However,
regardless of the linkage method, it is often the case that not all
records are linked. Further, linkage rates usually vary with
characteristics of analytical interest and this differential linkage can
bias analyses restricted just to linked records. While linked records
have full outcome and covariate information, unlinked records exhibit
“block-missingness” whereby the values for the entire block of variables
contained in the file that is linked to are missing for unlinked
records. Similar missing data structures occur in other contexts,
including panel studies when participants decline participation in one
or more study waves. In this paper, I consider the problem of adjusting
for linkage bias from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives. A
basic distinction is whether analysis is based on all available data or
just the linked cases. The Bayesian perspective leads to the former
option and to Gibbs sampling and multiple imputation as reasonable
methods. Basing analysis only on the linked cases seems to require a
frequentist perspective and leads to inverse probability of linkage
weighting and conditional maximum likelihood as reasonable approaches.
The implications of the assumption of ignorable linkage also differ
somewhat between the approaches. A simulation investigation confirms
that, assuming ignorable linkage given observed data, multiple
imputation, conditional maximum likelihood and inverse probability of
linkage weighting all succeed in adjusting for linkage bias and achieve
nominal interval coverage rates. Conditional maximum likelihood is
slightly more efficient than inverse probability of linkage weighting
and that multiple imputation can be more efficient than conditional
maximum likelihood. Extensions to the case of non-ignorable linkage are
also considered.
