<span>**Abstract:**</span> Since the proper operation of semiconductor devices is of crucial
importance for the reliability of a vast range of products, issues
concerning quality control are of central relevance to manufacturers.
This quality control task is concerned with high temperature operating
life tests, where devices are exposed to high temperatures, pressures or
humidity, which causes the devices to age artificially fast.

Based on measurements of a random sample of devices, the aim of this
work is to compute tolerance limits, such that all subsequent
measurements during the stress test stay within their predefined
specification limits with a given high probability. These tolerance
limits can then be used by automated test equipment for the quality
control of devices directly from the production line without their prior
exposure to stress test conditions.

In this study, we model the drift behavior of electrical parameters
using linear and cubic hermite splines, which are assumed to resemble
the true, yet unobserved drift behavior. These spline models allow for
the computation of probabilities for an electrical parameter to stay or
leave its specification limits at a given point in time. While a very
restrictive choice of the tolerance limits might achieve a high level of
reliability, the resulting yield loss might get unnecessarily high.
Therefore, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the
probability for initial measurements to be within the tolerance limits
(in order to minimize the resulting yield loss) and where the
reliability requirement is formulated as a constraint. A derivative-free
search algorithm is proposed for this optimization problem, which is
then used to test the performance and validity of the model.
