<span>**Abstract:**</span> Especially in the automotive industry, semiconductor devices are key
components for the proper functioning of the entire vehicle. Therefore,
issues concerning the reliability of these components are of crucial
importance to manufacturers of semiconductor devices.

In this quality control task, we consider longitudinal data from high
temperature operating life tests. Manufacturers then need to find
appropriate tolerance limits for their final electrical product tests,
such that the proper functioning of their devices is ensured. Based on
these datasets, we compute tolerance limits that could then be used by
automated test equipment for the ongoing quality control process.
Devices with electrical parameters within their respective tolerance
limits can successfully finish the production line, while all other
devices will be discarded. In calculating these tolerance limits, our
approach consists of two steps: First, the observed measurements are
transformed in order to capture measurement biases and gauge
repeatability and reproducibility. Then, in the second step, we compute
tolerance limits based on a multivariate copula model with skew normal
distributed margins. In order to solve the resulting optimization
problem, we propose a new derivative-free optimization procedure.

The capability of the model is demonstrated by computing optimal
tolerance limits for several drift patterns that are expected to cover a
wide range of scenarios. Based on these computations, we show the
resulting yield losses and analyze the performance of the tolerance
limits a large simulation study.
