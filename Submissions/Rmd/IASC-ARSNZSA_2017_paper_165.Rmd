<span>**Abstract:**</span> There is a difficulty in finding an estimate
of variance of the profile likelihood estimator in the joint model of
longitudinal and survival data. We solve the difficulty by introducing
the “statistical generalized derivative”. The derivative is used to show
the asymptotic normality of the estimator without assuming the second
derivative of the density function in the model exists.
