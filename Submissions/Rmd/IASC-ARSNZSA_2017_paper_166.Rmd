<span>**Abstract:**</span> In integrative analysis of multiple types of
-omics data, it is often of interest to infer associations between two
different types of molecules. The prevailing analysis methods depend on
ensemble of brute-force pairwise univariate association tests between
the two types, best exemplified by expression quantitative loci (eQTL)
mapping. In a nutshell, this problem can be generally framed as a sparse
cross-covariance matrix. In this work, we propose a two-stage estimator
of cross covariance matrix ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ between $p$-vector
${\mathbf{X}}$ and $q$-vector ${\mathbf{Y}}$, assuming that the two
variables have regulatory relationships and that we know a group
structure in the variables in ${\mathbf{X}}$. We first decompose the
covariance matrix of ${\mathbf{X}}$, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}$, into
systematic covariance consistent with the functional group information
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)}$ and the residual covariance not explained
by the group information ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}$. Following this
decomposition, we estimate the cross covariance matrix by multi-response
group lasso, yielding
${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}= {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}{\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)} = ({\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(G)} + {\mathbf{\Sigma_{XX}}}^{(R)}) {\mathbf{B}}_{(p \times q)}$.
As a result of this decomposition, ${\mathbf{\Sigma_{XY}}}$ can also be
expressed as the sum of a systematic term and a residual term, breaking
down the cross-covariance into a fraction attributable to pathway-level
regulation and the rest. We applied the method to epigenetic regulation
analysis of mRNA expression by DNA methylation in the The Cancer Genome
Atlas invasive breast cancer cohort.
