<span>**Abstract:**</span> Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of
the most popular methods in multivariate data analysis, which can be
applied to covariance matrices. Despite the popularity of the method,
there is no widely adopted standard approach to select the number of
principal components to retain. To address this issue, we propose a
novel method utilizing the hypothesis testing framework and test whether
the currently selected principal components capture all the
statistically significant signals in the given data set. While existing
hypothesis testing approaches do not enjoy the exact type 1 error
property and lose power under some scenarios, the proposed method
provides an exact type 1 error control along with decent size of power
in detecting signals. Central to our work is the post-selection
inference framework which facilitates valid inference after data-driven
model selection; the proposed hypothesis testing method provides exact
type 1 error controls by conditioning on the selection event which leads
to the inference. We also introduce a possible extension of the proposed
method for high-dimensional data.
