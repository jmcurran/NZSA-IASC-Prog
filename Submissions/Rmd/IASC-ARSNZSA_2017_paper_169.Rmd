<span>**Abstract**</span>. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for
spatial clustering of the high-dimensional functional data based on the
effects of functional covariates. We couple the functional mixed-effects
model with a generalized spatial partitioning method for: (1)
identifying subregions for the high-dimensional spatio-functional data;
(2) improving the computational feasibility via parallel computing over
subregions or multi-level partitions; and (3) addressing the
near-boundary ambiguity in model-based spatial clustering techniques.
The proposed model extends the existing spatial clustering techniques to
produce spatially contiguous partitions for spatio-functional data. The
model successfully captured the regional effects of the atmospheric and
cloud properties on the spectral radiance measurements. This elaborates
the importance of considering spatially contiguous partitions for
identifying regional effects and small-scale variability.
