<span>**Abstract:**</span> Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major
multifactorial condition that predisposes adults to type 2 diabetes and
cardiovascular disease. It is defined as having at least three of five
cardiometabolic risk components: 1) high fasting triglyceride level, 2)
low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 3) elevated fasting
plasma glucose, 4) large waist circumference (abdominal obesity) and 5)
hypertension. In the US Study of Womenâ€™s Health Across the Nation
(SWAN), a 15-year multi-centre prospective cohort study of women from
five racial/ethnic groups, the incidence of MetS increased as midlife
women underwent the menopausal transition (MT). A model is sought to
examine the interdependent progression of the five MetS components and
the influence of demographic covariates.
