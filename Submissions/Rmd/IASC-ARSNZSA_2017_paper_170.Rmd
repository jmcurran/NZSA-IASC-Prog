<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this study we examine how family structure affects the academic
achievement of students at the secondary level of education age in
Tonga. It is a comparative study aiming to find out whether there is a
significant difference between the academic achievements of students
from a traditional family and those from a non-traditional family. We
define a Tongan traditional family as being two biological parents (or
adoptive parents from birth), one male and one female where as
non-traditional family can be a single parent family, or the student has
no parent present (for example they are staying with relatives or
friends). In our study we are looking at what are the key drivers of
success and trying to understand the relationship between academic
achievements and family structure. We hope the study will provide
evidence-based information to aid the administrators, other educators
and parents to adopt the best practices and actions for the students.
The target population for this study is the high school students age 13
to 18 in Tonga. The study is limited to the high schools in the main
island of Tonga- Tongatapu which has 12 high schools where two high
schools are government schools and the others are private schools run by
different religions. In April we surveyed 360 students, 60 from each of
6 high schools, and present here our preliminary results.
