High dimensional covariance estimation and graphical models is a
contemporary topic in statistics and machine learning having widespread
applications. The problem is notoriously difficult in high dimensions as
the traditional estimate is not even positive definite. An important
line of research in this regard is to shrink the extreme spectrum of the
covariance matrix estimators. A separate line of research in the
literature has considered sparse inverse covariance estimation which in
turn gives rise to graphical models. In practice, however, a sparse
covariance or inverse covariance matrix which is simultaneously
well-conditioned and at the same time computationally tractable is
desired. There has been little research at the confluence of these three
topics. In this paper we consider imposing a condition number constraint
to various types of losses used in covariance and inverse covariance
matrix estimation. This extends the approach by Won, Lim, Kim, and
Rajaratnam (2013) on multivariate Gaussian log likelihood. When the loss
function can be decomposed as a sum of an orthogonally invariant
function of the estimate and its inner product with a function of the
sample covariance matrix, we show that a solution path algorithm can be
derived, involving a series of ordinary differential equations. The path
algorithm is at- tractive because it provides the entire family of
estimates for all possible values of the condition number bound, at the
same computational cost of a single estimate with a fixed upper bound.
An important finding is that the proximal operator for the condition
number constraint, which turns out to be very useful in regularizing
loss functions that are not orthogonally invariant and may yield
non-positive-definite estimates, can be efficiently computed by this
path algorithm. As a concrete illustration of its practical importance,
we develop an operator-splitting algorithm that imposes a guarantee of
well-conditioning as well as positive definiteness to recently proposed
convex pseudo-likelihood based graphical model selection methods (Zhang
and Zou, 2014; Khare, Oh, and Rajaratnam, 2015).

This is a joint work with Sang-Yun Oh (UC Santa Barbara) and Bala
Rajaratnam (UC Davis).
