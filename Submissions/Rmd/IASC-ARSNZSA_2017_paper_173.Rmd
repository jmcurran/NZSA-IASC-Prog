<span>**Abstract:**</span> We present a new statistical test of
association between a trait and genetic markers, which we theoretically
and practically prove to be robust to arbitrarily complex population
structure. The statistical test involves a set of parameters that can be
directly estimated from large-scale genotyping data, such as those
measured in genome-wide associations studies. We also derive a new set
of methodologies, called a genotype-conditional association test, shown
to provide accurate association tests in populations with complex
structures, manifested in both the genetic and non-genetic contributions
to the trait. We demonstrate the proposed method on a large simulation
study and on the real data. Our proposed framework provides a
substantially different approach to the problem from existing methods.
