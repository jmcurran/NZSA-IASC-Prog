<span>**Abstract:**</span> We propose a Bayesian nonparametric (BNP)
model, which is built on a class of species sampling models, for
estimating density functions of temporal data. In particular, we
introduce species sampling mixture models with temporal dependence. To
accommodate temporal dependence, we define dependent species sampling
models by modeling random support points and weights through an
autoregressive model, and then we construct the mixture models based on
the collection of these dependent species sampling models. We propose an
algorithm to generate posterior samples and present simulation studies
to compare the performance of the proposed models with competitors that
are based on Dirichlet process mixture models. We apply our method to
the estimation of densities for the price of apartment in Seoul, the
closing price in Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), and climate
variables (daily maximum temperature and precipitation) of around the
Korean peninsula.
