<span>**Abstract:**</span> We present a new approach to model selection
and Bayes factor determination, based on Laplace expansions (as in BIC),
which we call Prior-based Bayes Information Criterion (PBIC). In this
approach, the Laplace expansion is only done with the likelihood
function, and then a suitable prior distribution is chosen to allow
exact computation of the (approximate) marginal likelihood arising from
the Laplace approximation and the prior. The result is a closed-form
expression similar to BIC, but now involves a term arising from the
prior distribution (which BIC ignores) and also incorporates the idea
that different parameters can have different effective sample sizes
(whereas BIC only allows one overall sample size $n$). We also consider
a modification of PBIC which is more favorable to complex models.
