<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this work, we propose semiparametric
Bayesian hierarchical additive mixed effects models for analyzing either
longitudinal data or clustered data with applications to dose-response
studies. In the semiparametric mixed effects model structure, we
estimate nonparametric smoothing functions of continuous covariates by
using a spectral representation of Gaussian processes and the
subject-specific random effects by using Dirichlet process mixtures. In
this framework, we develop semiparametric mixed effects models that
include normal regression and quantile regressions with or without shape
restrictions. In addition, we deal with the Bayesian nonparametric
measurement error models, or errors-in-variable regression models, using
Fourier series and Dirchlet process mixtures, in which the true
covariate is not observable, but the surrogate of the true covariate, is
only observed. The proposed methodology is compared with other existing
approaches to additive mixed models in simulation studies and benchmark
data examples. More importantly, we consider a real data application for
dose-response analysis, in which measurement errors and shape
constraints in the regression functions need to be incorporated with
inter-study variability.
