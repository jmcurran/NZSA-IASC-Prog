<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper describes an implementation of mobile learning initiative in
Bioinformatics Training & Education Center (BITEC) for medical doctors
supported from Ministry of Welfare and Public Health Korea. This project
was initiated by Dept. of Bioinformatics & Statistics KNOU and Dept. of
Medical Informatics of SNU Medical College for training medical doctors.
The high penetration rates of mobile phone subscriptions and the rapid
growing of handheld users show that it is viable for making inroads
towards the usage of mobile devices as an alternative learning mode for
distance learning. The mobile learning initiative is aimed to encourage
learning and interactions in distance learning communities aiming to
bridge the transactional distances faced by the learners and adopt
mobility as the key tool in Bioinformatics courses delivery. The BITEC
m-Learning initiative focuses on introducing Bioinformatics using
handheld devices to be made easily accessible through the use of mobile
devices for ODL Bioinformatics learners who are very busy medical
doctors in ubiquitous learning environment. The m-Learning approach is
considered as a learning alternative to support distance learners mainly
working doctors and medical researchers in Korea. This research paper
discusses the implementation of the mobile e-Book approach which has
better affordable, accessible and flexible educational media.
