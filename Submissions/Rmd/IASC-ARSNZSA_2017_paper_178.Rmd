<span>**Abstract**</span>. We consider a power transformation through
the well-known Box-cox transformation to induce normality from
non-Gaussian long memory processes and propose a Bayesian method to
simultaneously estimate the transformation parameter and long memory
parameter. To ease computational burdens due to the dense
variance-covariance matrix of long memory time series, we base our
statistical inference on the wavelet domain rather than the original
data domain. For a joint estimation of the parameters of interest,
posterior estimations are carried out via Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC). An application to German stock return data is presented.
