<span>**Abstract:**</span> The raw meteorological data need to be cleaned since they
are from the diverse sources such as ASOS(Automated Synoptic Observing
System) and AWS(Automatic Weather Station). The meteorological data in
South Korea is observed from about 100 ASOS and 500 AWS. In order to
produce the high qualified meteorological data, several data quality
control algorithms are applied. In this study, cluster analysis for
almost 600 meteorological sites is applied depending on their climatic
characteristics. After clustering, we propose the several threshold
algorithms in the given cluster. The proposed threshold values for data
quality control algorithms will be adequate to Korea climate condition
by cluster and month. Thresholds of QC algorithms, which are step test,
persistence test and climate range test, are determined. Through these
algorithms and threshold, the qualified meteorological data can be
produced for the improved forecast accuracy.
