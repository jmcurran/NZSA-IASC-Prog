<span>**Abstract:**</span> Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic
phenomenon that the expression of an allele copy depends on its parental
origin. This mechanism has been found to play an important role in many
diseases. Methods for detecting imprinting effects have been developed
primarily for autosomal markers. However, no method is available in the
literature to test for imprinting effects on the X chromosome.
Therefore, it is necessary to suggest methods for detecting such
imprinting effects. In this talk, the parental-asymmetry test on X the
chromosome (XPAT) is first developed to test for imprinting for
qualitative traits in the presence of association, based on family trios
each with both parents and their affected daughter. Then, we propose
1-XPAT to tackle parent-daughter pairs, each with one parent and his/her
affected daughter. By simultaneously considering family trios and
parent-daughter pairs, C-XPAT is constructed to test for imprinting.
Further, we extend the proposed methods to accommodate complete (with
both parents) and incomplete (with one parent) nuclear families having
multiple daughters of which at least one is affected. Simulations are
conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods under
different settings. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
methods control the size well, irrespective of the inbreeding
coefficient in females being zero or nonzero. By incorporating
incomplete nuclear families, C-XPAT is more powerful than XPAT using
only complete nuclear families. For practical use, these proposed
methods are applied to analyze the rheumatoid arthritis data.
