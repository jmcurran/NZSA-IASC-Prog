<span>**Abstract:**</span> With the prevalent usage of microarray and
massively parallel sequencing, numerous high-throughput omics datasets
have become available in the public domain. Integrating abundant
information among omics datasets is critical to elucidate biological
mechanisms. Due to the high- dimensional nature of the data, methods
such as principal component analysis (PCA) have been widely applied,
aiming at effective dimension reduction and exploratory visualization.
In this paper, we combine multiple omics datasets of identical or
similar biological hypothesis and introduce two variations of
meta-analytic framework of PCA, namely MetaPCA. Regularization is
further incorporated to facilitate sparse feature selection in MetaPCA.
We apply MetaPCA and sparse MetaPCA to simulations, three transcriptomic
meta-analysis studies in yeast cell cycle, prostate cancer, mouse
metabolism, and a TCGA pan-cancer methylation study. The result shows
improved accuracy, robustness and exploratory visualization of the
proposed framework.
