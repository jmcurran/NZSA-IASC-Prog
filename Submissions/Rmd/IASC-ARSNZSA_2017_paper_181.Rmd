<span>**Abstract:**</span> A case-cohort design is an efficient study
design for analyzing failure time data by reducing the cost and effort
of conducting a large cohort study. Estimation of regression
coefficients is typically done through a weighted estimating equation
approach whose weight is the inverse of the sampling probabilities.
Several techniques to enhance the efficiency by estimating weights or
calibrating weights based on auxiliary variables have been developed for
Cox models. In this paper, we propose to extend these methodologies to
semiparametric additive hazards models. The proposed estimators are
demonstrated to be more efficient, via simulation studies, than the
usual Horvitz-Thompson type estimator. We illustrate a use of the
proposed estimators by using the National Wilms Tumor Study data.
