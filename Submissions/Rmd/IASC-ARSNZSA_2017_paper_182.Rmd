<span>**Abstract:**</span> A variety of data visualization methods are
utilizing to analyze huge amount of data. Among various methods, a
three-dimensional image requires the rotation of the image to show
stereo image on the two-dimensional screen. This study discusses data
visualization education of two methods (static method and dynamic
method) which make it possible to analyze the construct of stereo image
to improve the restriction of the three-dimensional image display with
virtual reality. This investigation can be useful to explore
three-dimensional data structure more clearly.
