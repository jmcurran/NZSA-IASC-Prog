<span>**Abstract:**</span> Inverse regression is an appearing dimension
reduction method for regression models with multivariate covariates.
Recently, it has been extended to the cases with functional or
longitudinal covariates. However, the extensions focus on one
functional/longitudinal covariate only. In this work, we extend
functional inverse regression to the cases with multivariate functional
covariates. The asymptotical properties of the proposed estimators are
investigated. Simulation studies and data analysis are also provided to
demonstrate the performance of our method.
