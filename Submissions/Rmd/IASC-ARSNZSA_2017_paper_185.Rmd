<span>**Abstract:**</span> We suggest a direct approach to estimate the coefficient functions for
function-on-function linear regression models. To avoid the risk of
discarding useful information for regressions, the approach does not
depend on basis representations or dimension reductions. It can
accommodate for multiple functional responses and multiple functional
predictors on different multidimensional domains, observed on dense or
irregular sparse grids. We demonstrate the performances of the approach
by simulation studies and a real application on calibrating numerical
weather forecasts.
