<span>**Abstract:**</span> Nowadays there are many research metrics at
the author-, article-, journal-levels, like the impact factors and
many others. However, none of them possess a universally meaningful
interpretation on the research influence at all levels, not mentioning
that many are subject-biased and consider neighboring relations only.
In this work, we introduce a new network-based research metric called
the network influence. It utilizes all information in the whole
network and it is universal to any levels. Due to its statistical
origin, this metric is computationally efficient and statistically
interpretable even if one applies it to a large-scale network. This
work demonstrates the analysis of networks via network influence using
a large-scale citation database called the Web of Science. By just
considering the articles among statistics community in 2005-2014, the
network influence of all articles are calculated and compared,
resulting in a top-ten important articles that are slightly different
from the list via impact factors. This metric can be easily extended
to author citation network and many similar networks embedded in the
Web of Science.
