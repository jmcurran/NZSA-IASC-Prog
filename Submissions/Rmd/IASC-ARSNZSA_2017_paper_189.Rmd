<span>**Abstract:**</span> As the two kinds of methods for model
specification problem, local smoothing tests and global smoothing tests
exhibit different characteristics. Compared with global smoothing tests,
local smoothing tests can only detect local alternatives distinct from
the null hypothesis at a much slower rate when the dimension of
predictor vector is high, but can be more sensitive to high-frequency
alternatives. We suggest a projection-based test that builds a bridge
between the local and global smoothing methodologies to benefit from
their own advantages. The test construction is based on a kernel
estimation-based local smoothing method and the resulting test becomes a
distance-based global smoothing test. A closed-form expression of the
test statistic is derived and the asymptotic properties are
investigated. Simulations and a real data analysis are conducted to
evaluate the performance of the test in finite sample cases.
