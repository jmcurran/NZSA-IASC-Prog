<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, we propose a new clustering
method to measure influence of papers in all areas of science. To see
structure of entire relationship we apply stochastic block model (SBM)
on big scale citation network data. SBM generates a matrix which divides
several blocks which represent relationship among research fields. We
show this matrix can be used to visual exploratory analysis. When lists
of papers are mapped this matrix we can get useful information by varied
locations in visually. Elastic Map is used as dimension reduction method
to calculate scalar value onto onto the corresponding principal points
of each papers. We demonstrate that this projection score is can be used
to evaluate divergence impact of papers across all field. To illustrate
one application of our method, we analyze 450k+ articles published
between 1981 and 2016 Web of Science data. In this beta version of our
system, Edward, probabilistic programming language is used for
estimation of SBM parameters and calculation of divergence score of
papers.
