<span>**Abstract:**</span> A large body of work has been devoted to
latent variable models applicable to multivariate binary data. However
little work has been put into extending these models to cases where the
observed data is multivariate binomial. In this paper, we will first
show that models that use either a logit or probit link function, offer
the same level of modelling flexibility in the binary case, but only the
logit link fits into a data augmentation approach that compactly extends
from binary to binomial. Secondly, we will demonstrate that multivariate
binomial data provides greater flexibility in how the link function can
be represented. Lastly, we will consider properties of the implied
distribution of latent probabilities under a logit link.
