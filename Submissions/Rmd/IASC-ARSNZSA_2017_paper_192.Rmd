<span>**Abstract:**</span> Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is considered an effective intervention to
improve physical function and reduce joint pain in those with end stage
knee arthritis, yet up to 34 What is reported herein is the
methodological approaches applied to tease out the various nuances of
developing such a clinical decision aid. By way of summary, a series of
logistic regression models were developed and refined to identify
predictors chronic postoperative pain, where pain was reported using the
numerical pain rating scale (NRS). Self-reported NRS pain was
dichotomized based on functional status using a defined statistical
approach. Multivariate models were developed using a stepwise selection
approach, accounting for interaction and collinearity. The effect of
changing collinearity thresholds on information criterion is
illustrated. The sensitivity and specificity were calculated, along with
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses for each logistic
model. Final models were chosen by a combination of superior area under
the curve (AUC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The stability of
Î² coefficients across the top performing models is reported, along with
model goodness-of-fit using the Hosmer and Lameshow methodology.
Cut-point analyses are reported on models performances, including the
effect of changing pain thresholds on model accuracy. Finally, the
conversion of a superior logistic model into a probabilistic function,
of potential utility for clinicians is illustrated.
