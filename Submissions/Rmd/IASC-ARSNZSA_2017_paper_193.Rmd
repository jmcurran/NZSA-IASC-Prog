<span>**Abstract:**</span> Including questions about sexual health in the annual Health Survey for
England (HSE) provides opportunities for regular measurement of key
public health indicators, augmenting Britain’s decennial National Survey
of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles (Natsal). However, contextual and
methodological differences may limit comparability of the findings. For
instance both surveys used self-completion for administering sexual
behaviour questions but this was via computer-assisted self-interview
(CASI) in Natsal-3 and a pen-and-paper questionnaire in HSE 2010. We
examine the extent of these differences between HSE 2010 and Natsal-3
(undertaken 2010-2012) and investigate their impact on parameter
estimates. For inclusion to this study, we restricted participants to
men and women in the 2010 HSE (n = 2,782 men and 3,588 women) and
Natsal-3 (n = 4,882 men and 6,869 women) aged 16-69 years and resident
in England. We compared their demographic characteristics, the amount of
non-response to, and estimates from, sexual health questions. We used
complex survey analysis to take into account stratification, clustering,
and weighting of the data in each survey. Logistic regression was used
to measure the extent to which sexual health estimates differ in HSE
2010 relative to Natsal-3, with multivariable models to adjust for
significant demographic confounders. Additionally, investigated
age-group interactions to see if differences between the surveys varied
by age. The surveys achieved similar response rates, both around 60While
a relatively high response to sexual health questions in HSE 2010
demonstrates the feasibility of asking such questions in a general
health survey, differences with Natsal-3 do exist. These are likely due
to the HSE’s context as a general health survey and methodological
limitations such as its current use of pen-and-paper questionnaires.
