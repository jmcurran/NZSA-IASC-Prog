<span>**Abstract:**</span> In the inference of ultra-high frequency data, the existing
methods are challenged by the tick-by-tick effect, namely, the
transactions recorded simultaneously at a time point. In this talk, we
will discuss how it influences the estimation of integrated volatility
matrix. The effect of microstructure noise and jumps will be discussed
as well. We propose to use a double-averaging procedure to deal with
these issues. The related asymptotic distribution of the proposed
estimator is established. Even interestingly, the double-averaging
estimator achieves the “oracle” property, that is, the asymptotic
efficiency is the same as that of the case that the exact trading time
of transactions are fully observed. Simulation studies support the
theoretical results. The estimation procedure is illustrated through a
real data analysis.
