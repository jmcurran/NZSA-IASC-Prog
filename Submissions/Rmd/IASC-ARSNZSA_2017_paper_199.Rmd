<span>**Abstract:**</span> The ALTREP provide framework provides infrastructure to support for
alternate representations of basic R objects. Some examples include R
vectors with data in memory-mapped files, compact representation of
arithmetic sequences, deferred computations, and adding meta-data to
objects. This talk will outline the framework, present some examples
of its use, and describe the current state of incorporating the
framework into the R distribution.
