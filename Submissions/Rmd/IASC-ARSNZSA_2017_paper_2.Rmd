<span>**Abstract:**</span> Obesity is a growing public health problem in New Zealand but
the trends of its determinants are unclear. We obtained the
confidentialised unit record files (CURF) of the New Zealand Health
Surveys (NZHS) from the Statistics New Zealand, containing multiple sets
of anonymised individual level data from 2002/03 to 2014/15. We assessed
the association between deprivation quintile and compliance with the
dietary guideline, and the prevalence of overweight/obesity. For adults,
we converted Body Mass Index (BMI) variable into tertiles. Then we
regressed the BMI tertiles on deprivation level, ethnicity, age, sex,
physical activity, education, smoking status, fruit guideline, vegetable
guideline, and household income variables using stepwise ordinal
logistic regression with complex survey design. We regressed the BMI
categories on deprivation level, ethnicity, age, sex, household income,
education, fruit guideline, vegetable guideline, soft drink consumption,
and fast food consumption in the child data. We found that people living
in the highest deprivation quintile were more likely to be in the higher
BMI tertile in adults and BMI category in children compared with those
living in the lowest deprivation quintile after adjusting for other
confounding variables. For adults and children the ORs (95
