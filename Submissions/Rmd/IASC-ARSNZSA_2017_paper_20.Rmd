<span>**Abstract:**</span> We investigate a non-homogeneous Gaussian
hidden Markov model where the model assumes the transition probabilities
between the hidden states depend on each discrete-time. The methodology
of the statistical inference for the model follows the Bayesian approach
implementing the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for parameter
estimation. The methods include: the Metropolis-Hastings, the delayed
rejection Metropolis-Hastings, the multiple-try Metropolis-Hastings, and
the adaptive Metropolis algorithms.

For simulation studies, we have successfully implemented all the
algorithms proposed on the simulated data set that was investigated by
Diebold et al. (1994), although we had been faced with the difficulties
of estimating each parameter due to the large noises in the data. For a
case study, the model was implemented on a data set of the monthly US
3-month treasury bill rates with six financial exogenous variables in
which the settings are identical to that of Meligkotsidou and
Dellaportas’s (2011), except for the algorithm.
