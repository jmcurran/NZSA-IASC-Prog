<span>**Abstract:**</span> We study the non-standardized Student's *t*-distribution for fitting serially correlated observations where serial dependence is described by the copula-based Markov chain. Due to the computational difficulty of obtaining maximum likelihood estimates, alternatively, we develop Bayes inference using the empirical Bayes method through the resampling procedure. We provide the simulations to examine the performance and also analyze the stock price data in empirical studies for illustration.
