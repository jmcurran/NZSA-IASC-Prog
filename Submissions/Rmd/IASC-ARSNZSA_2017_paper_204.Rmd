<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper introduces e-learning courses for principles and methods of introductory statistics, which is developing for undergarduate students. The course consists of the following contents; Usages and linkages to the official statistics in Japan, videos titled statistics for daily life, and interactive learning contents. For this course, we have developed Japanese versions of interactive Java applets for understanding statistical concepts and a tool for the simulation and data analysis. We expect that combination of these tools and e-learning contents not only makes students easy to understand basic concepts of statistics but also motivate students to study statistics.
