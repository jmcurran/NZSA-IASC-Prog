<span>**Abstract:**</span> In our digital age, what's the best way to measure inflation? We find an abundance of new data sources, yet these are *found data* in the sense that measuring CPI inflation is a secondary use of the data. Coverage and access become key issues. Automated, scalable, price measurement methods are a must. In this session we take stock and explore the path to a *big data* Consumers Price Index (CPI) for New Zealand.

We discuss the drivers for change and the benefits to a big data approach, reflecting on our early adoption of model-based approaches to price measurement, such as using a hedonic model for second-hand cars, and retail transaction---scanner data---for consumer electronics products (including TVs, computers, digital cameras) in the Consumers Price Index. 

We look towards the future by considering the opportunities that are currently in front of us. Notably, we recently signed up to the supply of daily web-scraped online price data from PriceStats, the commercial counterpart of MIT's Billion Prices Project.
