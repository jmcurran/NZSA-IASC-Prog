<span>**Abstract:**</span> As part of Stats NZ's initiative to explore alternative methods of data collection for price indexes we are currently investigating web scraping. In the short term we are looking to substitute manual online collection, in the medium term we are looking to produce a real-time *Digital Food Price Index*. We will demonstrate a basic technique of web scraping through the R package `rvest`. We will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of web scraping more sophisticated websites, and using web scraped data in the production of official price indexes. Some challenging questions in this area are regarding the reliability, relevance, and ethics of using internet prices. Will web scraping make us too reliant on external data sources? Do online prices reflect what consumers pay? Is the publicly available data truly public, or does it belong to the company?
