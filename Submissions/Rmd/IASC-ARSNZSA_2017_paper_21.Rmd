<span>**Abstract**</span>. Clustering aims to partition a set of
observations into a proper number of clusters with similar objects
allocated to the same group. Current partitioning methods mainly include
those based on some measure of distance or probability distribution.
Here we propose a mode-based clustering methodology motivated via
density estimation and mode identification procedures. The idea is to
estimate the data-generating probability distribution using a
nonparametric density estimator and then locate the modes of the density
obtained. In the nonparametric mixture models, each mode and the
observations ascend to it correspond to a single cluster. Thus, the
problem of determining the number of clusters can be recast as a mode
merging problem. A criterion of measuring the separability between modes
is also addressed in this work. The most similar modes would be merged
sequentially until the optimal number of clusters is reached. The
performance of the proposed method is investigated on both simulated and
real datasets.
