<span>**Abstract:**</span> Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely
used in dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data. It
identifies principal components by sequentially maximizing the component
score variance around the mean. However, in many applications, one is
interested in capturing the tail variations of the data rather than
variation around the center. To capture the tail characteristics, Tran
et al. (2016), based on an asymmetric $L_2$ norm, proposed principle
expectile components (PECs). In this study, we introduce a new method
called Huber-type principal expectile component (HPEC) using an
asymmetric Huber norm to produce robust PECs. The statistical properties
of HPECs are derived, and a derivative free optimization approach,
particle swarm optimization (PSO), is used to find HPECs. As a
demonstration, HPEC is applied to real and simulated data with
encouraging results.
