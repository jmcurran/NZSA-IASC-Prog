<span>**Abstract**</span>. The estimation of covariance or precision
(inverse covariance) matrices plays a prominent role in multivariate
analysis. The usual estimator, the sample covariance matrix, is known to
be unstable and ill-conditioned in high-dimensional setting. In the past
two decades, various methods have been developed to give a stable and
well-conditioned estimator and they have their own advantages and
disadvantages. We will review some of the most popular methods and
describe a new method to estimate the correlation matrix and hence the
covariance matrix using the empirical Bayes method. Similar to many
element-wise methods in the literature, we also assume that the elements
in a correlation matrix are independent of each other. We use the fact
that the elements in a sample correlation matrix can be approximated by
the same one-parameter normal distribution with unknown means , along
with the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimation to give a new
estimator of the correlation matrix. Preliminary simulation results show
that the new estimator has some advantages over various thresholding
methods in estimating sparse covariance matrices.
