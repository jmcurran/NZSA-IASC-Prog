<span>**Abstract:**</span> Using a unique database containing
information on the amount of R&D tax credits and regional, national and
European subsidies received by firms in French NUTS3 regions over the
period 2001-2011, we provide new evidence on the efficiency of R&D
policies taking into account spatial dependency across regions. By
estimating a spatial Durbin model with regimes and fixed effects, we
show that in a context of yardstick competition between regions,
national subsidies are the only instrument that displays total leverage
effect. For other instruments internal and external effects balance each
other resulting in insignificant total effects. Structural breaks
corresponding to tax credit reforms are also revealed.
