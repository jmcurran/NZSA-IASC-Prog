<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper aims to propose a data-adaptive
model averaging estimation in the high-dimensional framework. To this
end, We first consider the orthogonal greedy algorithm (OGA) proposed by
Ing and Lai (2011) to construct a set of nested models. The
high-dimensional model averaging criteria (HDMMA) suggested by Ing
(2016) is considered upon the OGA nested models, while the penalty term
is unknown and needed to be estimated. We then use the cross-validation
to select the optimal penalty. This method of penalty selection is shown
to be optimally adaptive to a wide class of data generating processes.
Furthermore, the resultant HDMMA estimator based on the selected penalty
is shown to be asymptotic rate efficient. Finally, numerical studies in
this paper are expected to shed some light on the choice of data
splitting ratio for the cross-validation.
