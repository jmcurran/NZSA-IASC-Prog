<span>**Abstract:**</span> Value-at-Risk (VaR) is a fundamental tool for
risk management and is also associated with the capital requirements of
banks. Banks need to adjust their capital levels for satisfying the
Basel Capital Accord. On the other hand, managements do not like to
change the capital levels too often. To achieve a balance, this study
proposes an approach to reduce the fluctuation of VaR estimation. The
first step is to fit a time series model to the underlying asset returns
and obtain the conventional VaR process. A new VaR (NVaR) estimation of
the conventional VaR process is then determined by applying change-point
detection algorithms and a proposed combination scheme. The capital
levels computed from the NVaR process are capable of satisfying the
Basel Accord and reducing the fluctuation of capital levels
simultaneously. To apply the proposed method to the calculation of
future capital requirements, an innovative approach for NVaR prediction
is also proposed by incorporating the concept of CUSUM control charts.
The return processes of 30 companies on the list of S$\&$P 500 from 2005
to 2016 are employed for our empirical investigation. Numerical results
indicate that the proposed NVaR prediction is capable of satisfying the
Basel Accord and reducing the fluctuation of capital requirements
simultaneously by using a comparable average amount of capital
requirements to the conventional VaR estimator.
