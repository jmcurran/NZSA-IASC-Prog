<span>**Abstract:**</span> In this paper, I investigate a false
discovery approach based on spatial scan statistics to detect the
spatial disease clusters in a geographical region proposed by Li et al.
(2016). The incidence of disease is assumed to follow an inhomogeneous
Poisson model discussed in Kulldorff (1997). I show that, though spatial
scan statistics are highly correlated, the simple Banjamini-Hochberg
(linear step-up) procedure can control the false discovery rate of them
by proving that the multivariate Poisson distribution satisfies the PRDS
condition (positive regression dependence on a subset) in Benjamini and
Yekutieli (2001).
