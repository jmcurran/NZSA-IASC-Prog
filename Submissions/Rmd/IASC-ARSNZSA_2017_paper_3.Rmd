<span>**Abstract**</span>. We propose a new online learning method for
Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models so called <span>*weakly conjugate
approximation*</span> (WCA). We consider classes of BNP priors which are
weakly conjugate. Here, ‘weakly conjugate prior’ means that the
resulting posterior can be easily approximated by an efficient MCMC
algorithm.

Suppose the whole data set is divided into two groups, say
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{old},{{\bf x}}^{new}).$ Then, the Bayes rule
implies
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}) \propto p({{\bf x}}^{new}|\theta) p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}),$
where $\theta$ is the parameter. WCA replaces
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})$ with $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$ where the proxy
parameter $\eta$ is estimated by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence
${\mathbb{E}}_{p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old})}\left\{ \log p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)\right\}.$
It can be easily approximated when we can generate samples from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ To be more specific, suppose
$\theta_1,\ldots,\theta_M$ are samples generated from
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{old}).$ Then, we can estimate $\eta$ by minimizing
$\sum_{j=1}^M\left\{ \log p(\theta_j|{{\bf x}}^{old}) - \log p^{wk}(\theta_j|\eta)\right\}/M.$

To apply WCA for online learning with multiple batches, suppose the
whole data ${{\bf x}}$ are divided into multiple small batches as
${{\bf x}}=({{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[S]}).$ A WCA algorithm
sequentially approximates
$p(\theta|{{\bf x}}^{[1]},\ldots,{{\bf x}}^{[s]})$ by
$p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_s),$ where $\eta_s$ is the proxy parameter
minimizing the approximated KL divergence. Since $p^{wk}(\theta|\eta)$
is weakly conjugate, we can easily generate samples from
$p({{\bf x}}^{[s]}|\theta)p^{wk}(\theta|\eta_{s-1}),$ and hence easily
update $\eta_s.$

We compare several online learning algorithms by analyzing
simulated/real data sets in Dirichlet process mixture models and
hierarchical Dirichlet processes topic models. The proposed method shows
better accuracy in our experiments.
