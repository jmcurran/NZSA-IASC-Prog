A semiparametric spatiotemporal model is postulated with data measured
at varying frequency. The model optimizes utilization of information
from variables measured at higher frequency by estimating its
nonparametric effect on the response through the backfitting algorithm.
Simulation studies support the optimality of the model over simple
generalized additive model with aggregation of high frequency data. The
method is then used in analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of corn
yield based on some remotely-sensed data as covariates.
