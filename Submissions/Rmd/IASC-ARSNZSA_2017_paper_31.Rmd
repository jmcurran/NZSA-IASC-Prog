<span>**Abstract**</span>. Since the introduction of the ARMA class in
the early 1970s many time series (TS) extensions have been proposed,
e.g., vector ARMA and GARCH-type models for heteroscedasticity. The
result has been a plethora of models having pockets of substructure but
little overriding framework. In this talk we propose a class of TS
models called Vector Generalized Linear Time Series Models (VGLTSM),
which can be thought of as multivariate generalized linear models
directed towards time series data. The crucial VGLM ideas are constraint
matrices, vector responses and covariate-specific linear predictors, and
estimation by iteratively reweighted least squares and Fisher scoring.
The only addition to the VGLM framework is a log-likelihood that depends
on past values. We show how several popular sub-classes of TS models are
accommodated as special cases of VGLMs, as well as new work that
broadens TS modelling even more. Algorithmic details of its
implementation in , and properties such as stationarity, parameters
depending on covariates, expected information matrices and cointegrated
TS are surveyed.
