<span>**Abstract:**</span> The <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span>
package[@RJ-2014-013] was first developed in 2003 to experiment with
features of the SVG format that were not available through a normal R
graphics device[@R], such as hyperlinks and animation. A number of
different R packages[@rsvgtipsdevice; @cairo; @svglite; @svgannotation]
have been developed since then to allow the generation of SVG output
from R, but <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> has remained unique in
its focus on generating structured and labelled SVG output. The reason
for that was to maximise support for customisation and reuse,
particularly unforseen reuse, of the SVG output. Unfortunately, there
were two major problems: killer examples of customisation and reuse
failed to materialise; and the production of SVG with
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was painfully slow. In brief,
<span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span> was a (sluggish) solution waiting
for a problem. This talk charts some of the developments over time that
have seen <span><span>**gridSVG**</span></span>â€™s patient wait for
relevance ultimately rewarded and its desperate need for speed finally
satisfied.
