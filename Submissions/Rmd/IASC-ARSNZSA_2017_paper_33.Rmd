<span>**Abstract:**</span> Currently, it is becoming easier to analyze
the various types of spatial data and express them visually on a map.
However, it is still difficult to estimate the location of spatial
clusters based on statistical evidence. The spatial scan statistic
(Kulldorff 1997), which is based on the idea of maximizing the
likelihood of cluster, has been widely used for spatial cluster
detection method. It is important how effectively and efficiently we
find a cluster whose likelihood is high, and to find such a cluster,
some scan approaches are proposed. However, most of them are limited in
the shape of a detected cluster, or need an unrealistic computational
time if the data size is too large. The zero-suppressed binary decision
diagram (ZDD) (Minato, 1993), one approach to frequent item set mining,
enables us to extract all of the potential cluster areas at a realistic
computational cost. In this study, we try a new way of spatial cluster
detection method to detect a cluster with truly highest likelihood by
applying the ZDD, and by using them, we compare and evaluate the
performance of the existing scan methods.
