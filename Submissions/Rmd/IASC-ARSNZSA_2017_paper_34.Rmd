<span>**Abstract:**</span> Group testing has been used for decades to
estimate the prevalence of a rare disease when samples from multiple
subjects can be pooled and tested as a group. A group testing design is
specified by the support points (distinct group sizes) and their
corresponding frequencies. In this series of works, we construct locally
optimal approximate designs for group testing with uncertain error
rates, where the goal is to maximize the precision of the prevalence
estimate. We also provide a guaranteed algorithm based on the
approximate theory for constructing exact designs for practical use. Our
simulated examples based on a Chlamydia study in the United States show
that the proposed design outperforms competing designs, and its
performance is quite stable to the working parameters. We then extend
the framework to accommodate two features likely to be encountered in
real-world studies. We develop optimal budgeted-constrained designs,
where both subjects and tests incur costs, and the error rates of the
the assay are linked to the group sizes, allowing dilution effects to
reduce the test performance. (Work done jointly with M.-N. L. Huang, K.
Shedden, and W. K. Wong.)
