<span>**Abstract:**</span> Suppose that the time series data is sufficiently explained by
a model, e.g., autoregressive model, transfer function model. A
change-point is considered to exist if any of the model parameters is
substantially different in two or more regimes. We proposed a test for
existence of a change-point (assuming that location of the change is
known) based on nonparametric bootstrap. The method is used in verifying
whether the southern oscillation index exhibits change-point which is
taken as an evidence of climate change. There is indeed an evidence of
climate change in the period.
