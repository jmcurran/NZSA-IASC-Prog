<span>**Abstract**</span>. We propose a new Bayesian methodology for
estimating discontinuous functions. In this model, the estimated
function is expressed by the overcomplete representation with multiple
kernels. Therefore, the complex shape of functions can be expressed by
the much smaller number of parameters due to the nature of the
sparseness. It does not need any assumptions about the location of
discontinuities, the smoothness of the function, the number of features.
The form of the function taking all of these into account is determined
naturally by the random Levy measure. Simulation data and real data
analysis show that this model is suitable for fitting discontinuous
functions. We also proved theoretical properties about the support of
the function space having jumps in this paper.
