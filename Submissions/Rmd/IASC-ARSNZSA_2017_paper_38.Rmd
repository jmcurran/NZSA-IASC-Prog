<span>**Abstract:**</span> The matching pursuit algorithm (MPA) is an
efficient solution for high dimensional variable selection (Bühlmann and
van de Geer, 2011). There is, however, no widely accepted stopping rule
for MPA. (Li et al., 2017) have given novel stopping rules based on
information theoretic criteria (ITC). All of these ITC are based on the
degrees of freedom (df) of the hat matrix which maps the data vector to
its estimate. We derive some properties of the hat matrix when MPA is
used. These allow us to give an upper bound on the possible increase in
df between successive MPA iterations. A simulation study with data
generated from different models compares the mean integrated square
error of the different ITC and cross validation (Sancetta, 2016).
