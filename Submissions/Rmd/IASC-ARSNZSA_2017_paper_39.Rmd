<span>**Abstract:**</span> Informal approaches to goodness-of-fit tests often involve examining the
visual fit of the model to data ’by eye’. Such approaches are
problematic for Year 13 and undergraduate students and teachers from a
pedagogical perspective as key aspects such as sample size, the number
of categories and expected variation of sample proportions are difficult
to consider. In formal tests for goodness-of-fit a test statistic is
used in reference to its sampling distribution to decide if the model
distribution can be rejected. In general, a numeric test statistic does
not have an obvious graphical representation within the data itself.
This talk presents a new informal goodness-of-fit test that uses a
simulation-based modelling tool. Drawing on ideas from graphical
inference, the proposed test does not use numerical test statistics but
plots as test statistics. Comparisons of performance demonstrate that
the proposed test leads to similar decisions about the fit of the model
distribution as the chi square goodness-of-fit test. A research study
with Year 13 teachers indicated that there could be pedagogical benefits
of using this informal goodness-of-fit test in terms of introducing
important modelling and hypothesis test concepts.
