<span>**Abstract:**</span> The joint models for longitudinal data and
time-to-event data have been introduced to measure the association
between longitudinal data and survival time in clinical, epidemiological
and educational studies.. The main aim of this talk is to estimate the
parameters in the joint models using a Bayesian approach for nonlinear
longitudinal data and time-to-event data using penalized splines. To
perform this analysis, the joint posterior distribution of hazard rate
at baseline, survival and longitudinal coefficient and random effects
parameters is first being introduced followed by derivation of the
conditional posterior distributions for each of parameter. Based on
these target posterior distributions, the samples of parameters are
simulated using Metropolis, Metropolis Hastings and Gibbs sampler
algorithms. An R program is written to implement the analysis. Finally,
the prior sensitivity analysis for the baseline hazard rate and
association parameters is performed following by simulations studies and
a case study.
