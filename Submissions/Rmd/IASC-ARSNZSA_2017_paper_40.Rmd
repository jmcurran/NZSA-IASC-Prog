<span>**Abstract**</span>. Genomic information such as genome-wide
association analysis (GWAS) in DNA data is very large, however if the
sample size corresponding to it is not enough, as an idea to solve, the
author considers by a statistical approach and a genetic approach. The
former will be briefly introduced, and the latter will be mainly
explained. Basically, the method of focusing genome information becomes
the center of presentation.

disequilibrium, statistical power
