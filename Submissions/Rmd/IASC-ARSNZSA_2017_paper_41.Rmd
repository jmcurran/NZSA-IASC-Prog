<span>**Abstract:**</span> The requirement for predictions to be made earlier in the growing season
has become more important, as the opportunity to plan for the wine
production and export earlier in the season becomes desirable. The issue
with this is there is less information available to those wishing to
make early predictions. The analysis in this paper implements a double
sigmoidal curve to model the grape growth over the growing season, as
this is typically used in agriculture.

In order to conduct prediction in this study, a Bayesian Network is
considered. This allows the opportunity to consider the knowledge of
experts in the field, where grape growers would know the growth
behaviour of the grapes, as well as using new data to update the
Bayesian Network. This information is then implemented in the form of
priors, which involves estimating the parameters of the aforementioned
double sigmoidal model. Sensitivity Analysis is done in this research,
which looks at the impact of prior assumptions (or lack thereof) from
experts. Examinations are also made of the value of adding information
to the model, as it can be determined whether the precision in the
predictions improves as a result of adding data. The results in this
analysis are based off simulation studies.
