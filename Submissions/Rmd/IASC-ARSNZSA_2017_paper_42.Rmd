<span>**Abstract:**</span> Let us consider a two-sample problem in
longitudinal data, and discuss comparison of tests of mean difference
using block resampling methods. The testing methods are based on moving
block bootstrap (MBB), circular block bootstrap (CBB) and stationary
bootstrap (SB). These block resampling techniques are used to
approximate the null distributions of the following four types of test
statistics: sum of absolute values of difference between two mean
sequences ($T_1$), sum of squares of difference between two mean
sequences ($T_2$), area-difference between two mean curves ($T_3$), and
difference of kernel estimators based on two mean sequences ($S_n$). Our
testing algorithm generates blocks of observations in each sample
similar to MBB, CBB or SB, and draws resamples *with replacement* or
*without replacement* from the mixed blocks which are generated by two
samples. In the context of block resampling, a resample is usually
generated *with replacement* from blocks of observations, however our
discussion also includes block resampling *without replacement* similar
to permutation analogy for MBB, CBB and SB, with $T_1$, $T_2$, $T_3$ and
$S_n$, respectively. Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to examine
the empirical level and power of the testing methods.
