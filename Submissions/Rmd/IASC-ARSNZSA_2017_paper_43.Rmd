<span>**Abstract**</span>. We often have “big data” expressed by both
continuous real variables and categorical variables. When their sizes
are huge, it is almost impossible to see and check each individual data.
Then we divide them into small number of groups which have clear domain
meanings. We express each group by using information up to second order
moments. For example, means, variances and covariances are used to
summarize many continuous real variables, and a Burt matrix which
consists of contingency tables by pairs of categorical variables are
used to summarize many categorical variables. We call such a set of
descriptive statistics “aggregated symbolic data (ASD)”.

We here propose dissimilarities between two ASDs by utilizing
pseudo-likelihood ratio test statistic and chi-squared test statistic.
Former one is theoretically derived and the latter one is heuristically
given. We adopt two dissimilarities for clustering districts in Tokyo by
ASD derived from huge real estate data.
