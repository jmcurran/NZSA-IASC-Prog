<span>**Abstract:**</span> We consider estimation of intensity function
for spatial point processes based on area-aggregated data. A standard
approach for estimating the intensity function for a spatial point
pattern is to use a kernel estimator. However, when data are only
available in a spatially aggregated form with the numbers of events
available in geographical subregions, traditional methods developed for
individual-level event data become infeasible. In this research, a
kernel-based method will be proposed to produce a smooth intensity
function based on aggregated count data. Some numerical examples will be
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
