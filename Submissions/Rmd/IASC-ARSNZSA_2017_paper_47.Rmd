<span>**Abstract:**</span> The textile set is defined from the textile
plot proposed by Kumasaka and Shibata (2007, 2008), which is a powerful
tool for visualizing high dimensional data. The textile plot is based on
a parallel coordinate plot, where the ordering, locations and scales of
each axis are simultaneously chosen so that all connecting lines, each
of which signifies an observation, are aligned as horizontally as
possible. The textile plot transforms a data matrix in order to
delineate a parallel coordinate plot. Using the geometric properties of
the textile set derived by Sei and Tanaka (2015), we show that the
textile set describes an intrinsically geometric structures of data.
