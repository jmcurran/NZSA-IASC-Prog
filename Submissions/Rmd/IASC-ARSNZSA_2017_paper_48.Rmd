<span>**Abstract:**</span> Model selection by information criteria can
be used to identify a single best model or for inference based on
weighted support from a set of competing models, incorporating model
selection uncertainty into parameter estimates and estimates of
precision. Anraku (1999) proposed a modified version of the well known
Akaike information criterion, selecting models in the one-way analysis
of variance models when the population means are subject to monotone
trends. A generalization of this order-restricted information criterion
was proposed by Kuiper et al. (2011), allowing a restriction of
population means by a mixture of linear equality and inequality
constraints.

An extension to this approach is presented, applying the generalized
order-restricted information criterion to model selection from a set of
generalized linear models. The class of models can comprise linear
equality or inequality constraints of population parameters assuming a
distribution of the exponential family for the response. The methodology
is illustrated using the open source environment R with the add-on
package `goric`.
