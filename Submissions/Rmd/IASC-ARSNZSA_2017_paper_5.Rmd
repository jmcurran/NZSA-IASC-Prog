<span>**Abstract**</span>. We introduce the *transfer regression*, a
method for constructing prior distributions for parameters defining
generalized linear models (GLM). The transfer regressions are based
frequency tables, usually obtained by categorizing the continuous
variables. So obtained prior information are transferred to the
parameters defining the second stage GLM based on detailed data. at the
second stage based on more detailed data. We illustrate these ideas by
showing how to compute posterior predictive probabilities of contracting
diabetes based on HbA1c data obtained from comprehensive medical
examinations.
