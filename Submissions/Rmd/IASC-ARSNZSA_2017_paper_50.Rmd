<span>**Abstract**</span>. Stats NZ are looking to move away from the
collection and publication of stand-alone surveys to making use of a
wide range of data sources and estimation strategies. A key component to
enabling this change is to develop the infrastructure which allows
analysts to explore, test and use a range of tools which are not
traditionally heavily used within National Statistics Offices. One of
the tools Stats NZ is looking to make heavier use of is R. This talk
will outline the development of internal RStudio and Shiny servers at
Stats NZ, and give examples demonstrating the types of innovation
RStudio has enabled at Stats NZ to improve the way we produce and
disseminate statistics.
