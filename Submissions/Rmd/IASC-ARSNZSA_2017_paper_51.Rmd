<span>**Abstract:**</span> Incomplete data complicate conventional statistical analyses because the
analyses presume complete data are always available. The primary problem
is the complication of the parameter estimation. The parameter
estimation is based on the observed-data log-likelihood function that
consists of the sum of the logarithm of the marginalized likelihood with
respect to the missing values, and thus the log-likelihood function
becomes complicated to handle. The EM algorithm was proposed to make it
easy to handle the log-likelihood function. However, the EM algorithm
still has some problems that are often criticized (McLachlan and
Krishnan, 2002); namely, slow convergence and unavailability of the
standard error.

In my talk, I propose an incomplete-data Fisher scoring (IFS) method
with an acceleration method to overcome these problems. The IFS method
takes a Newton-Raphson type iteration, but it produces exactly the
identical sequence or an approximate sequence to the sequence produced
by the EM algorithm. The notable feature of the IFS is that the IFS can
accelerate itself by adjusting its steplength and can produce the
standard error with the functions used only for the acceleration. The
convergence rate is faster than the EM algorithm. In the talk, I provide
the convergence theorem and practical examples.
