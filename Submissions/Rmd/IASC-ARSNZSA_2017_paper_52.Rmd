<span>**Abstract:**</span> Shape-restricted regression, in particular
under isotonicity and convexity(concavity) constraints, has many
practical applications. Traditional nonparametric methods to the problem
using least squares or maximum likelihood result in discrete step
functions or nonsmooth piecewise linear functions, which are
unsatisfactory both predictively and visually. In this talk, we describe
a new, smooth, nonparametric estimator under the above-mentioned shape
restrictions. In particular, the discrete measures that are inherent in
the previous estimators are replaced with continuous ones. A new
algorithm that can rapidly find the corresponding estimate will also be
presented. Numerical studies show that the new estimator outperforms
major existing methods in almost all cases.
