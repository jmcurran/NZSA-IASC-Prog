<span>**Abstract:**</span> This presentation is focused on how R is used
in Romanian official statistics to improve the quality of results
provided by different statistical data sources on the base of
administrative data. Some benefits for statistical analysis come when it
is possible to link administrative records from different registers
together, or when they can be linked with censuses or sample surveys.
Many of these record linkage or matching methods must be done under
statistically conditions, R program being one of the most powerful
analysis tool. In Romania, there has been increasing attention in recent
years to use R in official statistics, through specialized R courses for
statisticians and training on the job sessions. A international
conference on R (uRos) is yearly organized to provide a public forum for
researchers from academia and institutes of statistics. It is also a
continuous work to develop statistics based on Big Data, Romania being
part of the ESSnet Big Data Project.
