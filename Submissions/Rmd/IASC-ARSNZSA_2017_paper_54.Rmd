<span>**Abstract:**</span> The demand for and volume of data from
surveys, registers or other sources containing sensible information on
persons or enterprises have increased significantly over the last
several years. At the same time, privacy protection principles and
regulations have imposed restrictions on the access and use of
individual data. Proper and secure microdata dissemination calls for the
application of statistical disclosure control methods to the data before
release. Traditional approaches to (micro)data anonymization, including
data perturbation methods, disclosure risk methods, data utility and
methods for simulating synthetic data have been made available in R.
After introducing the audience to the R packages sdcMicro and simPop,
the presentation will focus on new developments and research for
generating close-to-reality synthetic data sets using specific
model-based approaches. The resulting data can work as a proxy of
real-world data and they are useful for training purposes, agent-based
and/or microsimulation experiments, remote execution as well as they can
be provided as public-use files. The strength and weakness of the
methods are highlighted and an (brief) application to the Euorpean
Statistics of Income and Living Condition Survey is given.
