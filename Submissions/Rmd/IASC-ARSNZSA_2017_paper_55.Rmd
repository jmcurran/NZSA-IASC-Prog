<span>**Abstract:**</span> In spite of recent growing interest in
applying the von-Mises distribution to circular data in various
scientific fields, researches on the parameter estimation are
surprisingly sparse. The standard estimators are the MLE and the maximum
marginal likelihood estimator (Schou 1978). Although Bayesian estimators
are promising, it looks that they have not been fully developed. We
propose the posterior mean of the canonical parameter, instead of the
mean parameter, under the reference prior. This estimator satisfies an
optimality property, and performs favorably for wide ranges of true
parameters. Extensive simulation studies yield that the risks of the
proposed estimator are significantly small, compared with the existing
estimators. An interesting finding is that the estimating function for
the dispersion parameter behaves reasonably. Notable advantages of the
present approach are its straightforward extensions to various
procedures, including Bayesian estimator under an informative prior
based on the reference prior. The proposed estimator is examined by
applying to practical datasets.
