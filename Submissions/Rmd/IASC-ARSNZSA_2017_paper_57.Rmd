<span>**Abstract:**</span> Nonlinear multivariate methods (NL-MM) using
optimal scaling as a quantification technique can analyze any data
including quantitative and qualitative variables. The alternating least
squares (ALS) algorithm is the most popular iterative algorithm in
NL-MM. While the algorithm has a stable convergence property, it
requires many iterations and a large computational cost, especially for
a large data set involving many qualitative variables, because its
convergence is linear. It is therefore important to improve the speed of
computation when NL-MM with the ALS algorithm is applied. Kuroda and his
co-workers tried to accelerate the convergence of the ALS algorithm
using the vector $\varepsilon$ (v$\varepsilon$) accelerator. In this
talk, the v$\varepsilon$ acceleration for the ALS algorithm is
implemented in NL-MM, e.g., nonlinear principal component analysis and
nonlinear factor analysis, and the performances are demonstrated in
numerical experiments.
