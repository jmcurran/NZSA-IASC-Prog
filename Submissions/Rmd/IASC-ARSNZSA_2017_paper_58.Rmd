<span>**Abstract:**</span> Given correlation matrices between variables
of subjects and these classes of subjects, it is important to get the
distinctive local networks for each class. For example, in fMRI data
analysis, such the situation is observed. In concretely, each
correlation matrix between regions of interests for his/her brain is
observed, and each information of class is get through the experiment.
In this presentation, to achieve the purpose, we proposed simultaneous
analysis for both clustering of variables and low-rank approximation of
correlation matrices corresponding to each class. For the estimation, we
adopt the majorization algorithm based on Pietersz and Groenen (2004)
and Simon and Abell (2010). Through the proposed method, we can get the
distinctive sparse correlation matrices corresponding to classes, while
we have to determine the number of clusters.
