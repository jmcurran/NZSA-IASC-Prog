<span>**Abstract**</span>. In some application of time series modeling,
it is necessary to obtain forecast of various types of data
automatically and possibly, in real-time. For instances, to forecast
large number of univariate series every day, or to do a real-time
processing of the satellite data. Various automatic algorithms for
modeling ARMA models are available in the literature, where here we will
discuss three methods in particular. One of the method is based on a
combination between the best exponential smoothing model to obtain the
forecast, together with state-space approach of the underlying model to
obtain the prediction interval (see Hyndman, 2007). The second method,
which is more advanced method, is based on X-13-ARIMA-SEATS, the
seasonal adjustment software by the US Census Bureau (see Sax , 2015).
From our previous study in Rosadi (2016), we found that these methods
are perform relatively well for SARIMA data. Unfortunately, these
approaches do not working well for many of ARMA data. Therefore in paper
we extend the study by considering an automatic modeling method based on
genetic algorithm approach (see Abo-Hammour, et.al., 2012). These
approaches are implemented in our R-GUI package RcmdrPlugin.Econometrics
which now already integrated in our new and more comprehensive R-GUI
package, namely RcmdrPlugin.SPSS. We provide application of the methods
and the tool. From some empirical studies, we found that for ARMA data,
the method based on genetic algorithm performs better than the other
approaches.
