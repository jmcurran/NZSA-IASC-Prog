<span>**Abstract:**</span> Common component analysis (CCA) was proposed
by generalizing techniques for principal component analysis (PCA) for a
common basic structure identification (Wang et al., 2011). Although CCA
can identify the common structure of multiple datasets, which cannot be
extracted by standard PCA, the common components by CCA are estimated as
linear combinations of all variables, and thus it is difficult to
interpret the identified common components. Furthermore, the CCA
procedure may be disturbed by noisy features, because CCA is based on
the fully dense loadings. To address these issues, we proposed sparse
common component analysis based on $L_{1}$-type regularized regression
modeling. The proposed CCA can be performed by iterative sparse
non-centered PCA for a square root of a gram matrix. We also propose an
algorithm to estimate sparse common loadings of multiple datasets in
line with the algorithm of CCA. We observe from the numerical studies
that the proposed CCA can incorporate sparsity into the common loading
estimation, and recover a sparse common structure efficiently in
multiple dataset analysis.
