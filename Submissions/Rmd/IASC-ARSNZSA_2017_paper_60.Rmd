<span>**Abstract**</span>. Temperature reconstruction is vital to
studies of climate change. Instrumental records are only available back
to 19th century, too short to describe changes that occur over hundreds
or thousands of years. Fortunately, nature environmental clues (such as
tree rings, pollens and ice cores) can be pieced together to reconstruct
unrecorded temperatures. We use tree-ring width to study summer
temperature in Northern Sweden for past 500 years. Previous work has
shown the predictions to be sensitive to model assumptions. We gain a
new insight into this problem by attempting to separately estimate
aspects of the process that are robustly estimated. One of these are the
years in which the climate is colder or warmer than recent observations.
We implement this by considering hidden Markov models on the partially
observed temperature series. The model is fitted using Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo in Stan.
