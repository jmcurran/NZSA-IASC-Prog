<span>**Abstract**</span>. The purpose of a global optimization
algorithm is to efficiently find an objective function’s global minimum.
In this talk we consider bound constrained global optimization, where
the search is performed in a box, denoted $\Omega$. The global
optimization problem is deceptively simple and it is usually difficult
to find the global minimum. One of the difficulties is that there is
often no way to verify that a local minimum is indeed the global
minimum. If the objective function is convex, the local minimum is also
the global minimum. However, many optimization problems are not convex.
Of particular interest in this talk are objective functions that lack
any special properties such as continuity, smoothness, or a Lipschitz
constant.

A random search algorithm for bound constrained global optimization is
presented. This algorithm alternates between partition and sampling
phases. At each iteration, points sampled from $\Omega$ are classified
low or high based on their objective function values. These classified
points define training data that is used to partition $\Omega$ into low
and high regions using a random forest. The objective function is then
evaluated at a number of points drawn from the low region and from
$\Omega$ itself. Drawing points from the low region focuses the search
in areas where the objective function is known to be low. Sampling
$\Omega$ reduces the risk of missing the global minimum and is necessary
to establish convergence. The new points are then added to the existing
training data and the method repeats.

A preliminary simulation study showed that alternating between random
forest partition and sampling phases was an effective strategy for
solving a variety of global optimization test problems. The authors are
currently refining the method and extending the set of test problems.
