<span>**Abstract**</span>. A multivariate two-sample testing problem is
one of the most important topics in nonparametric statistics. Further, a
max-type Baumgartner statistic based on the modified Baumgartner
statistic (Murakami, 2006) was proposed by Murakami (2012) for testing
the equality of two continuous distribution functions. In this paper, a
max-type multivariate two-sample Baumgartner statistic is suggested
based on the Jurečková and Kalina’s ranks of distances (Jurečková and
Kalina, 2012). Simulations are used to investigate the power of the
suggested statistic for various population distributions. The results
indicate that the proposed test statistic is more suitable than various
existing statistics for testing a shift in the location, scale and
location-scale parameters.
