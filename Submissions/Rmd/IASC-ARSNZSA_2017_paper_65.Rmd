<span>**Abstract:**</span> A semiparametric mixed analysis of covariance model is postulated and
estimated using the two procedures: based on an imbedded restricted
maximum likelihood (REML) and nonparametric regression (smoothing
splines) estimation into the backfitting framework (ARMS); and infusing
bootstrap into the ARMS (B-ARMS). The heterogeneous effect of covariates
across the groups is postulated to affect the response through a
nonparametric function to mitigate overparameterization. Using
simulation studies, we exhibited the capability of the postulated model
(and estimation procedures) in increasing predictive ability and
stabilizing variance components estimates even for small sample size and
with minimal covariate effect, and regardless of whether the model is
correctly specified or there is misspecification error.
