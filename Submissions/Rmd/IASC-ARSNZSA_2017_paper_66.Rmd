<span>**Abstract:**</span> Multimix is the name for a class of multivariate finite mixture models
designed with clustering (<span>*unsupervised learning*</span>)
in mind. It is also a name for a program to fit these models,
written in Fortran77 by Lyn Hunt as part of her Waikato PhD thesis.

Why convert to R? Although written in the 1990s Multimix is easy to convert to modern
GNU Fortran (gfortran) but there are advantages to having an R
version available. For users this means a simpler way of reading in
the data and describing the form of the model. Also for ongoing
development of improvement and modifications of the Multimix models.
Râ€™s interactive environment provides a more comfortable place
for experimentation.

Designing the new program. Rather than attempt any sort of translation of the old code, the new
R version of Multimix is designed from the beginning as an
R program. In my talk I will describe some of the design decisions
made and the reasons for them. A particular concern was that the R
version be as fast as possible.

How to package up the new program?
Two versions of Multimix in R have been developed, a
<span>*global*</span> version with many global variables employed,
and a <span>*nested*</span> version restricting the scope of
variables to the surrounding function. The pluses and minuses of
each approach will be described.

I am conscious that I may not always have made the best design decisions
and comments from others will be welcomed.
