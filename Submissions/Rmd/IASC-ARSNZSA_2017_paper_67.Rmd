<span>**Abstract**</span>. Spatio-temporal statistical datasets are
becoming widely available for social, ecomonic, and environmental
researches, however it is often difficult to summarize it and undermine
hidden spatial/temporal patterns due to its complexity. Geographically
weighted principal component analysis (GWPCA), which uses a moving
window or kernel and applies localized PCAs over geographical scape, may
be worth to do it, while to optimize kernel bandwidth size and to
determine the number of component to retain (NCR) were the most concern
(Tsutsumida et al (2017)). In this research we determine both of them
together simultaneously so as to minimize leave-one-out residual
coefficient of variation of GWPCA with changing bandwidth size and NCR.
As a case study we use annual goat population statistics across 341
administrative units in Mongolia in 1990-2012, and show spatiotemporal
variations in data, especially influenced by natural disasters.
