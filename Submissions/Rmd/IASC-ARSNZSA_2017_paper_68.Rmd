<span>**Abstract:**</span> A three-stage framework is developed for fitting a mixture of
regressions for high dimensional data. The method combines a
hierarchical agglomerative grouping algorithm, regression-based
clustering, and a sequential, group-wise sparse estimation called
Layered Elastic Net Selection (LENS). A simulation study is used to
compare the method with LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
predictive accuracy, selection optimality, and clustering accuracy. All
simulation scenarios are high dimensional (n&lt;&lt;p), wherein the best
subset of predictors may or may not vary among clusters. When the group
of most important predictors varies among regression components, the
combination of ordinary least squares (OLS) and LENS for mixture of
regressions outperforms LASSO-type and PC-based strategies in terms of
prediction and clustering accuracy. Based on simulation, the method
(termed as MixLENS) results to optimal variable selection, and applying
OLS on selected variables results to better prediction and clusters.
OLS-MixLENS may result to a more interpretable model that is as
predictive as a full model (e.g. Mixture of PC Regressions). In general,
MixLENS is likely to select an optimal small subset of predictors for
modeling.
