<span>**Abstract**</span>. As recent requirements for numerical
computation performed by R become larger and more complicated, errors
from floating-point arithmetic become problematic. In R, double
precision floating-point arithmetic is usually performed, but it may not
be adequate or precise for some situations. To avoid and detect errors
of double precision floating-point arithmetic, multiple precision
arithmetic is useful. Several multiple precision arithmetic packages
exist on R, but their abilities are limited. Therefore we provide
another multiple precision arithmetic package Rmpenv, which can handle
multiple precision arithmetic for real and complex numbers, matrix
product and inversion, etc. We also provide a syntactic sugar to make
easy the multiple precision computation on R. We utilize a free and open
source MPACK library for multiple precision arithmetic and linear
algebra computation.
