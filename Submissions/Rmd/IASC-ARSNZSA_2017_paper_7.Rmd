<span>**Abstract:**</span> An empirical analysis of the mean return and conditional variance of
Nigeria Stock Exchange (NSE) index is performed using various error
innovations in GARCH models. Conventional GARCH model which assumed
normal error term failed to capture volatility clustering, leptokurtosis
and leverage effect as a result of zero skewness and kurtosis
respectively. We re-modify error distributions of GARCH (p,q) model
inference using some thick-tailed distributions. Method of Quasi-Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) was used in parameter estimation. The robust
model that explained the NSE index is determined by loglikelihood and
model selection Criteria. Our result shows that GARCH model with
fat-tailed densities improves overall estimation for measuring
conditional variance. The GARCH model using Beta-Skewed-t distribution
is the most successful for forecasting NSE index.
