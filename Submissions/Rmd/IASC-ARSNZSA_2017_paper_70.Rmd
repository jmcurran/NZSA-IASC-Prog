<span>**Abstract:**</span> Visualisation techniques are widely used to
successfully enhance the knowledge discovery in data base processes and
a broad spectrum of visualisation approaches for classification problems
exist. A core aim of applying visual techniques in the data analysis
process is to ease the interaction between algorithms and the user. In
general, there are three main stages in the analysis process, namely
algorithm selection, model construction, and model evaluation, that can
be enhanced by the use of appropriate visualisation techniques. In
particular, context knowledge of the data owner is considered to be of
vital importance and often provides a substantial input to improve
modelling results. For this purpose, visual displays provide an
important means of communication between content expert and data
analyst. Many real life classification problems are characterised by the
class imbalance between the various categories of the response variable,
e.g. credit risk scoring, fraud detection, concession cases or military
conflicts. These imbalances pose a particular challenge to visualisation
that go beyond the mere question of image resolution.

In this talk we investigate how visualisation needs and can be adapted
to support the further analysis of class-imbalanced data. Looking at
continuous and categorical predictors we evaluate the visual
comparability of graphical representations for imbalanced data at all
three stages of the analysis process. Using the large tool kit of **R**
graphics, we provide a taxonomy of the effect of class-imbalance on the
visual displays for data exploration. Displays of model quality and
model comparisons are evaluated with a focus on predictive models
derived from ensemble methods. Here, a specific emphasis is put at the
interplay between graphical representations and applying data level
methods and algorithmic level methods to handle class imbalances.
