<span>**Abstract:**</span> Let $\mathbf{X}_{g1}, \mathbf{X}_{g2}, \ldots, \mathbf{X}_{gn_g}$ be i.i.d. random samples of
size $n_g$ from a $p$-dimensional population $\Pi_g$
($g \in \{1, 2\}$) with
$\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{X}_{gi})={\boldsymbol\mu}_g$
and ${\rm var}({\mbox{\boldmath ${X}$}}_{gi})=\Sigma_g$
($i \in \{1, \ldots ,n_g\}$). In this talk, our primary interest is to
test following hypothesis when $p > \min\{n_1-1, n_2-1 \}$:
$$\begin{aligned}
H_0 : {\boldsymbol\mu}_1 = {\boldsymbol\mu}_1,~ \Sigma_1 = \Sigma_2 \quad 
\mbox{vs.} \quad H_1 : \mbox{not}~ H_0.
\end{aligned}$$

For this problem, we discuss an $L^2$-norm-based test for simultaneous
testing of mean vectors and covariance matrices among two non-normal
populations. To construct a test procedure, we propose a test statistic
based on both unbiased estimator of differences mean vectors proposed by
Chen and Qin (2010) and covariance matrices proposed by Li and Chen
(2012). Also, we derive an asymptotic distribution of this test
statistic and investigate the asymptotic sizes and powers of the
proposed test. Finally, we study the finite sample and dimension
performance of this test via Monte Carlo simulations.
