<span>**Abstract:**</span> We address the statistical problem of
detecting change-points in the stress-strength reliability $R=P(X<Y)$ in
a sequence of paired variables $(X,Y)$. Without specifying their
underlying distributions, we embed this non-parametric problem into a
parametric framework and apply the maximum likelihood method via a
dynamic programming approach to determine the locations of the
change-points in R. Under some mild conditions, we show the consistency
and asymptotic properties of the procedure to locate the change-points.
Simulation experiments reveal that in comparison with existing
parametric and non-parametric change-point detection methods, our
proposed method performs well in detecting both single and multiple
change-points in R in terms of the accuracy of the location estimation
and the computation time. It offers robust and effective detection
capability without the need to specify the exact underling distribution
of the variables. Applications to real data demonstrate the usefulness
of our proposed methodology for detecting the change-points in the
stress-strength reliability R.
