<span>**Abstract:**</span> A personalized medicine have been improved
through the statistic analysis of Big data such as registry data. In
these researches, subgroup identification analysis have been focused on.
The purpose of the analysis is detecting subgroup such that the efficacy
of the medical treatment is effective based on predictive factors for
the treatment.

Foster et al., (2011) proposed the subgroup identification method based
on two stage approach, called Virtual Twins (VT) method. In the first
stage of VT, the difference of treatment effect between treatment group
and control group is estimated by Random Forest. In the second stage,
responders are identified by using CART, where the estimated these
differences are set as the predictor variables.

However, the prediction accuracy of RandomForest tends to be lower than
that of Boosting. Therefore, generalized boosted model (Ridgeway, 2006)
is adopted in the first step. In addition to that, the number of rules
tend to be large in the second step when CART is used. In this paper, we
adopt a priori algorithm as the same way of SIDES(Lipkovich et al.,
2011).
