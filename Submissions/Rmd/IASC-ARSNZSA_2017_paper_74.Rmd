<span>**Abstract:**</span> In questionnaire surveys, multiple regression analysis is usually used
to evaluate influence factors. In addition to that, data mining methods
such as Classification and Regression Trees (Breiman et al., 1984) are
also used. In the research for tourism studies, it is difficult to
contribute the policies for landscape or buildings from the results. In
this paper, we call these factors “ uncontrollable exploratory
variables". On the other hands, the polices for amounts of garbages or
inhabitant consciousness can be contributed from the results. We call
these factors “controllable exploratory variables". The purpose of this
report is grading for each subject which is conducted based on
controllable exploratory variables with adjusting the effects of
uncontrollable exploratory variables. Concretely, we modified the AIM
method (Tian and Tibshirani, 2010) and conduct gradings based on the sum
of the production rules for controllable exploratory variables with
adjusting the effects of uncontrollable exploratory variables.
