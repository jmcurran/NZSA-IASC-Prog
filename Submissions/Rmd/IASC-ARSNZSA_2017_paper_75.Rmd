<span>**Abstract**</span>. The purpose of this study is to build a
simple and intuitive wrapper method, stepwise SVM, for reducing
dimension and classification of large p small n datasets. The method
employs a suboptimum search procedure to determine the best subset of
variables for classification. The proposed method is compared with other
dimension reduction methods, such as Pearson product moment correlation
coefficient (PCCs), Recursive Feature Elimination based on Random Forest
(RF-RFE), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) by using five gene
expression datasets. In this study, we show that stepwise SVM can
effectively select the important variables and perform well in
prediction. Moreover, the predictions of reduced datasets from stepwise
SVM are better than that of the unreduced datasets. Compared with other
methods, the performance of stepwise SVM is more stable than PCA and
RF-RFE but it is difficult to tell the difference in performance from
PCCs. In conclusion, stepwise SVM can effectively eliminate the noise in
data and improve the prediction accuracy.
