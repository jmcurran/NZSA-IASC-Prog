<span>**Abstract:**</span> Monitoring dose patterns over time helps physicians and patients learn
more about metabolic change, disease evolution, etc. One way to turn
such longitudinal data into clinically useful information is through
cluster analysis, which aims to separate the “profiles of doses” among
patients into homogeneous subgroups. Different doses patterns reflect
heterogeneity in patients’ characteristics and effectiveness of therapy.
However, not all patients were prescribed at regular time points, and
missing values seems ubiquitous if one aligns records at distinct time
points. Moreover, a few outliers may heavily influence the estimation
for within and/or between variations of clusters, making the distinction
among clusters blurred. In this study, a simple method based on a novel
pairwise dissimilarity is proposed, which also serves as a screen tool
to detect potential outliers. We use smoothing splines, handling data
observed either at regular or irregular time points, and measure the
dissimilarity between patients based on pairwise varying curve estimates
with commutation of smoothing parameters. It takes into account the
estimation uncertainty and is not strongly affected by outliers. The
effectiveness of our proposal is shown by simulations comparing it to
other dissimilarity measures and by a real application to methadone
dosage maintenance levels.
