<span>**Abstract**</span>. The growing availability of GPS tracking
devices means that public transport passengers can now check on the
real-time location of their bus from their mobile phone, helping them to
decide when to leave home, and once at the stop, how long until the bus
arrives. A side effect of this technology is that statistical models
using vehicle location data to predict arrival times have taken a “back
seat” in preference for methods that are simpler and faster, but less
robust. Auckland Transport, who operate our local public transport
network, demonstrate this: the estimated arrival time (ETA) of a bus at
a stop is simply the time until scheduled arrival, plus the delay at the
bus’ most recently visited stop. The most evident problem with this
approach is that intermediate stops, traffic lights, and road
congestion—all of which affect ETAs—are not considered. We have been
developing a modelling framework consisting of (1) a vehicle state model
to infer parameters, such as speed, from a sequence of GPS positions;
(2) a transit network model that uses information from the vehicle model
to estimate traffic conditions along roads in the network; and (3) a
predictive model combining vehicle and transit network states to predict
arrival times. Since multimodality is common—for example a bus may or
may not stop at a bus stop or traffic lights—we are using a particle
filter to estimate vehicle state, which makes no assumptions about the
shape of the distribution, and allows for a more intuitive likelihood
function. While this provides a very flexible framework, it is also a
computationally intensive one, so computational demands need to be
considered to ensure it will be viable as a real-time application for
providing passengers with improved, and hopefully reliable, arrival time
information.
