<span>**Abstract:**</span> A company with a focus on retail crime
prevention brought to MINZ (Mathematics in Industry in New Zealand) the
task of “<span>*Who is most likely to offend in my store, now*</span>”.
The company supplied an anonymised set of data on incidents and
offenders. The task, for the statisticians and mathematicians involved,
was to try to find ways to use the data to nominate, say, the top ten
likely offenders for any particular store and any particular time, using
up-to-the-minute information (real time). The problem was analogous to
finding a regression model when every row of data has response
identically 1 (an incident), and for many places and times there is no
data. This talk will describe how the problem was tackled.
