<span>**Abstract:**</span> Three-mode three-way data (objects $\times$
variable $\times$ conditions) have been observed in many areas of
research. For example, panel data often include values for the same
objects and variables at different times. Given two three-mode three-way
data sets, we often investigate two types of factors: common factors,
which show the relationships between the two data sets, and unique
factors, which represent the uniqueness of each data set. In light of
this, canonical covariance analysis has been proposed. However, these
datasets often have numerical and categorical variables simultaneously.
Many multivariate methods for two three-mode thee-way data sets assume
that the data has numerical variables only. To overcome this problem, we
propose three-mode three-way canonical covariance analysis with
numerical and categorical variables. We use an optimal scaling method
(for example, Yong (1987)) for the quantification of categorical data
because the values of a categorical variable could not be compared with
the value of a numerical variable.
