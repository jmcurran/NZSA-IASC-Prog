<span>**Abstract:**</span> Statistical inverse problems occur when we
wish to learn about some random process that is observed only
indirectly. Inference in such situations typically involves sampling
possible values for the latent variables of interest conditional on the
indirect observations. This talk is concerned with inverse problems for
count data, for which the latent variables are constrained to lie on the
integer lattice within a convex polytope (a bounded multidimensional
polyhedron). An illustrative example arises in transport engineering
where we observe vehicle counts entering or leaving each zone of the
network, then want to sample possible interzonal patterns of traffic
flow consistent with those entry/exit counts. Other problems with this
structure arise when conducting exact inference for contingency tables,
and when analysing capture-recapture data in ecology.

In principle such sampling can be conducted using Markov chain Monte
Carlo methods through a random walk on the lattice polytope, but it is
challenging to design algorithms for doing so that are both
computationally efficient and have guaranteed theoretical properties.
The seminal work of Diaconis and Sturmfels (1998) on Markov bases
addresses some of the theoretical issues, but has significant practical
limitations. In this talk I shall discuss some preliminary findings
based on a more geometric approach to sampler design.
