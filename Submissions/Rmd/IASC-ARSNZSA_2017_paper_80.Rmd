<span>**Abstract:**</span> It is widely accepted that in the sport of
cricket, batting is more difficult early in a player’s innings, but
becomes easier as a player familiarizes themselves with the local
conditions. Here we develop a Bayesian survival analysis method to
predict and quantify the Test Match batting abilities for international
cricketers, at any stage of a player’s innings. The model is applied in
two stages, firstly to individual players, allowing us to quantify
players’ initial and equilibrium batting abilities, and the rate of
transition between the two. The results indicate that most players begin
a Test match innings batting with between a quarter and a half of their
potential batting ability. The model is then implemented using a
hierarchical structure, providing us with more general inference
concerning a selected group of opening batsmen from New Zealand. Using
this hierarchical structure we are able to make predictions for the
batting abilities of the next opening batsman to debut for New Zealand.
These results are considered in conjunction with other performance based
metrics, allowing us to identify players who excel in the role of
opening the batting, which has practical implications in terms of
batting order and team selection policy.
