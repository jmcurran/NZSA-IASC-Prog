<span>**Abstract:**</span> This paper develops a no-arbitrage network of yield curves model for the
euro area to study the joint dynamics of and risk transmission across
yield curves of different economies. The model nests 1+M yield curves of
a benchmark country and M periphery countries with 3+(2+M) state
factors. The benchmark curve is spanned by three yield factors, which
are also common basis for all curves. Periphery yield spreads are
spanned by three factors, including two common risk factors related to
market liquidity risk and common sovereign credit risk, and a
country-specific risk factor. Parsimony can be guaranteed as M increases
with additional yield curve data, and factors can be strongly identified
with structural restrictions under the no-arbitrage conditions. We
estimate a 1+5 yield curves model for Germany and GIIPS countries using
weekly data from 2009 to 2016. The results show that, the German yields
enjoy a ‘flight to liquidity’ effect under a liquidity shock, which
pushes down German yields while driving up periphery spreads. However,
in response to a shock of common sovereign credit risk, yields of all
countries, including Germany, tend to increase immediately and
persistently. The weaker is a country’s economic fundamental, the higher
its risk exposure to shocks. Though spillover effects among periphery
curves are generally positive, when a Greek shock bursts, the Italian
risk factor may be temporarily mitigated due to its relative stronger
economy. The network model can be adapted with a time-varying parameter
VAR to monitor evolving contributions of factors.
