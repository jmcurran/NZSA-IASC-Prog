<span>**Abstract:**</span> Measure of expected years of life lost (EYLL) of a cohort of subjects
living with specific conditions would be useful for quantifying and
thereby comparing the societal burden of different conditions. One
promising approach of estimating EYLL is based on relative survival
between the index cohort and an age- and sex-matched reference
population generated from vital statistics to extrapolate survival
function of the index cohort. The EYLL is then estimated by computing
the area between the survival curve of the reference population and
extrapolated survival curve of the index cohort. In this talk, we will
introduce our newly developed method called rolling survival
extrapolation algorithm which consists of two major stages. First, we
apply logit transformation to the relative survival so that the
transformed curve beyond follow-up would approximate to a nearly
straight line. Second, similar to the rolling forecast process for
predicting the future over a set period of time, we take advantage of
the accurate short-term extrapolation of restricted cubic splines models
to guide the transformed relative survival forward step-by-step using
the model updated data. There are some studies that provide general
evidence for long-term associations of air pollution with hospital
admissions and death of various causes. We have found no published
epidemiological studies on the effects of long-term air pollution
exposure and life years lost. With the proposed method, we estimate EYLL
from long-term exposure to air pollution among Taiwanese adult
population at rural township and city district levels. The results show
that elderly people living in a worse local air pollution for decades
long had more expected years of life lost after adjusting social
economic status.
