<span>**Abstract:**</span> Scientific collaborations are among the main
enablers of development in small national science systems. Although
analysing scientific collaborations is a well-established subject in
scientometrics, evaluations of collaborative activities of countries
remain speculative with studies based on a limited number of fields or
using data too inadequate to fully represent collaborations at a
national level. This study provides a unique view on the collaborative
aspect of scientific activities in New Zealand. We perform a
quantitative study based on all Scopus publications in all subjects for
over 1500 New Zealand institutions over a period of 6 years to generate
an extensive mapping of New Zealand scientific collaborations. The
comparative results reveal the levels of collaboration between New
Zealand institutions and business enterprises, government institutions,
higher education providers, and private not for profit organisations in
2010-2015. Constructing a collaboration network of institutions, we
observe a power-law distribution indicating that a small number of New
Zealand institutions account for a large proportion of national
collaborations. Network centrality measures are deployed to identify the
most influential institutions of the country in terms of scientific
collaboration. We also provide comparative results on 15 universities
and crown research institutes based on 27 subject classifications. This
study was based on Scopus custom data and supported by the Te PÅ«naha
Matatini internship program at Ministry of Business, Innovation &
Employment.
