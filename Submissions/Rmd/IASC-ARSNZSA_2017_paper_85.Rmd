<span>**Abstract:**</span> Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability.
While moderate and severe forms of TBI develop the most significant
impairments even mild TBI may be followed by persisting post-concussion
symptoms, neurocognitive problems and mental health disorders such as
anxiety. Cognitive impairments can impact on all areas of an
individual’s work, home and social life and are important to understand
and predict overall recovery. These outcomes may be in part be
determined by genetic variants that influence the molecular and
physiological response of the brain to damage, as well as determining
pre-injury reserve and vulnerability to co-morbidities.

A number of studies have examined the relationship between genetic
variants and outcomes following TBI. Most have examined groups with
moderate to severe injury and are limited by small sample sizes,
selection biases, failed to correct for ethnic factors, and have
evaluated outcomes at various time points, making comparison between
studies difficult.

Using the population-based study of TBI in NZ (BIONIC) we analysed the
association between cognitive outcomes with 18 genetic markers
(SNPs-single nucleotide polymorphisms) from 12 genes previously studied
in relation with TBI; FAAH, GAD1, WWC1, CHMR2, ANKK1, BDNF, NGB, BCL2,
APOE, S100B, HMOX1 and COMT in a sample of 183 European and 76 Maori
adults. We used the CNS-Vital Signs (computerised neurocognitive test
battery) to provide 11 measures of cognitive functioning, memory and
attention collected at baseline, 1-, 6-, 12- and 48 months post-injury.

ANCOVA models were used to identify the association between time, SNP
(modelled as major, heterozygous and minor alleles) and SNP by time
effect for each CNS-Vital Signs outcome. Statistically significant
findings were observed in both European and Maori samples for being
associated with the same CNS-Vital Signs outcome for rs8191992 (CHMR2),
rs4680 (rs4680), rs2071746 (HMOX1) and rs17071145 (WWC1).

A linear mixed effects model was utilised to analyse each individual’s
natural cognitive recovery trajectory over time. The individuals’ age,
gender, whether or not this was their first TBI, the severity level of
the mild TBI (low, medium or high) and SNP were all included in the
model as covariates.

Regression analyses identified the following SNPs to be statistically
associated with several CNS-Vital Signs outcomes; rs8191992 (CHMR2) was
shown to be associated with attention, neurocognition, composite memory,
executive functioning as well as processing and psychomotor speed in
Europeans.

Whilst rs3798178 (GAD1) was associated with two domains of attention,
neurocognition and three domains of memory (composite, visual and
working) in Maori. We found rs3791879 was associated with increased
attention and neurocognition in our European sample.

Furthermore, the minor alleles of rs11604671 (ANKK1) were associated
with poorer cognitive recovery (compared to those with homozygous major
alleles) for two domains of attention, executive functioning, processing
speed, social acuity and working memory over time in Maori. We found
rs11604671 was associated with reduced executive functioning and
processing speed in our European sample

Unlike other genetic studies on TBI patients, our study investigated
several different genetic variants in a larger ethnically diverse
population sample of individuals with primarily mild TBI. Although our
findings agreed with previous literature for genetic associations for
cognitive recovery post-injury, for the first time, we were able to
identify ethnic differences in specific genetic markers determining
specific cognitive outcomes in European and Maori people with TBI.
Further large TBI population based cohort studies are warranted to
replicate these genetic associations, both locally and globally in order
to better understand the differences underlying an individual’s outcome
trajectory and inform more effective treatment strategies.
