<span>**Abstract:**</span> We have been annoyed by tons of unwilling
accesses in many Internet applications including SSH (Secure SHell)
known as a typical remote access tool and E-mail delivery protocols. An
attacked server put a report according to the configuration and the log
files have grown day by day.

Bad accesses might be caused by computer virus and so-called
<span>*zombie*</span>, a hi-jacked computer. We assume that the actions
would have their own trends. For example, we sometimes find that a few
attacks come simultaneously from only 1 site, however, we also find
several attacks from a set of the sites within 1 minute or 1 day. The
IP-Addresses might be variable, however, within the assigned range. It
suggests that the victimizer is just one but gets an IP-Address
allocation so many times.

To analyze the log files and give an interpretation to them, we
introduce Symbolic Data Analysis (SDA) to adopt its main idea
<span>*concept*</span>. If we configure an appropriate
<span>*concept*</span> whose elements (<span> *individuals*</span> in
SDA) are IP-Address, port-numbers and attack time span, we can reveal
some relationship between <span>*concepts*</span> and classify them into
perspective. The results would give us some useful information to
protect our Internet environment.

We discuss how we get them and the interpretation appropriately through
some practical examples.
