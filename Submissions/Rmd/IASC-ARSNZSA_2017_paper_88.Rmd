<span>**Abstract**</span>. We consider Bayesian static parameter
estimation for partially observed stochastic systems with discrete-time
observations. This is a very important problem, but is very
computationally challenging as the associated posterior distributions
are highly complex and one has to resort to discretizing the associated
probability law of the underlying stochastic system and advanced Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques to infer the parameters. We are
interested in the situation where the discretization is in multiple
dimensions. For instance, for partially observed stochastic partial
differential equations (SPDEs), where dicretization is in both space and
time. In such cases, multi-index Monte Carlo (MIMC) is known to have the
potential to reduce the computational cost for a prescribed level of
error, relative to i.i.d. sampling from the most precise discretization.
We demonstrate how MCMC and particularly particle MCMC can be used in
the multi-index framework for Bayesian static parameter inference for
the above-mentioned models. The main idea involves constructing an
approximate coupling of the posterior density of the joint on the
parameter and hidden space and then correcting by an importance sampling
method. Our method is illustrated numerically to be preferable for
inference of parameters for a partially observed SPDE.
