<span>**Abstract:**</span> When we have new “big data”, the first step
may be to visualize them. For visualizing continuous multivariate data,
interactive parallel coordinate plot is known to be appropriate.
However, the number of data is huge and some variables are categorical,
a simple parallel coordinate plot is not available. We propose to divide
big data into rather small groups and summarize them as aggregated
symbolic data (ASD), and visualize them by triangular arranged parallel
coordinate plots.

We have developed a statistical graphics software for this purpose. Our
software equips interactive operations such as selection and linked
highlighting, and is written by Java, R, and big data processing
technologies such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.

Aggregated symbolic data is a set of descriptive statistics calculated
by up to second order moments of variables in each group. We also
propose further summarization of ASD to describe characteristics of each
variable and a pair of variables for visualizing the difference among
ASDs. Real example data are visualized by our software and interpreted
intuitively.
