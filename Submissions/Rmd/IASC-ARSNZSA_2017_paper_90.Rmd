<span>**Abstract:**</span> For the analysis of two-way contingency
tables with ordered categories, Yamamoto, Tahata, Suzuki and Tomizawa
(2011) considered a measure to represent the degree of departure from
marginal point-symmetry. The maximum value of the measure cannot
distinguish two kinds of marginal complete asymmetry with respect to the
midpoint. The present article proposes a measure which can distinguish
two kinds of marginal asymmetry with respect to the midpoint. It also
gives large-sample confidence interval for the proposed measure.
