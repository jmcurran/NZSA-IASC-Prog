<span>**Abstract:**</span> The New Zealand rugby community is aware of safety issues within the
junior game and has applied weight limits for each tackle grade to
minimize injury risk. However, for heavier children this can create an
uncomfortable situation as they may no longer be playing with their peer
group. The study evaluated almost 13,000 observations from junior rugby
players across three seasons (2015-2017) using data supplied by
Wellington Rugby. To protect privacy, the data was structured so that an
individual could not be readily identified but could be tracked across
seasons to determine churn. As data for several consecutive seasons was
available, we could determine the likelihood of a junior player
returning the following season and isolate the drivers of this
behaviour. Applying a logistic regression and repeated measures analysis
the study determined if children who are over the specified weight limit
for their age group are more likely to leave the game. Furthermore,
assuming the importance of playing with peers, the study identified the
impact of age in relation to the date-of-birth cut-off of January 1st.
This is of interest given that a child playing above their age-weight
grade could be competing against individuals three school years above
them. The study primarily focuses on determining the optimal age-weight
bands while the secondary focus is on determining the likelihood of a
junior Wellington rugby player returning the following season and
isolating the drivers of this behaviour.
