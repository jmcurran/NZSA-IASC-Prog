<span>**Abstract**</span>. In a massive data setting, we focus on a
semiparametric regression model involving a real dependent variable $Y$
and a $p$-dimensional covariable $X$. This model includes a dimension
reduction of X via an index $X'\beta$. The Effective Dimension Reduction
(EDR) direction $\beta$ cannot be directly estimated by the Sliced
Inverse Regression (SIR) method due to the large volume of the data. To
deal with the main challenges of analysing massive datasets which are
the storage and computational efficiency, we propose a new SIR estimator
of the EDR direction by following the “divide and conquer” strategy. The
data is divided into subsets. EDR directions are estimated in each
subset which is a small dataset. The recombination step is based on the
optimisation of a criterion which assesses the proximity between the EDR
directions of each subset. Computations are run in parallel with no
communication among them. The consistency of our estimator is
established and its asymptotic distribution is given. Extensions to
multiple indices models, $q$-dimensional response variable and/or
SIR$_{\alpha}$-based methods are also discussed. A simulation study
using our `edrGraphicalTools` R package shows that our approach enables
us to reduce the computation time and conquer the memory constraint
problem posed by massive datasets. A combination of `foreach` and
`bigmemory` R packages are exploited to offer efficiency of execution in
both speed and memory. Results are visualised using the
bin-summarise-smooth approach through the `bigvis` R package. Finally,
we illustrate our proposed approach on a massive airline data set.
