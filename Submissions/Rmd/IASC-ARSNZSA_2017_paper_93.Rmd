<span>**Abstract**</span>

In supervised learning, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is widely
used for dimension reduction problems. When using dimension reduction
methods, researchers should always aim to preserve the data structure in
a low dimensional space. However, if the obtained data are assumed to be
multimodal labeled data, that is, each cluster can be subdivided into
several latent clusters, CCA is rarely able to preserve the data
structure in a low dimensional space.

In this study, we propose local CCA (LCCA) for multimodal labeled data.
This method is based on local Fisher discriminant analysis (LFDA)
(Sugiyama, 2007). We do not employ the same local covariance matrix of
the explanatory variables as under LFDA, which uses a local
between-group variance matrix and a local within-group variance matrix.
Instead, in our proposed method, we use a covariance matrix of the
explanatory variables as well as a weighted affinity matrix. The
usefulness of LCCA in data visualization and clustering is then
demonstrated by simulation studies.
