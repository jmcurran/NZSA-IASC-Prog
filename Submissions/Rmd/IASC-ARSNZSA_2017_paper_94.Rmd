<span>**Abstract:**</span> Structural equation models have been used extensively for continuous
variable data to find causal structures. In such a framework, the Linear
Non- Gaussian Acyclic Model (LiNGAM) could enable finding a whole causal
model (Shimizu et al., 2006). However, in many desciplines, the data
include both continuous and discrete variables. LiNGAM could fail to
capture the actual causal relationship for such data because it handles
both discrete and continuous variables as continuous. Therefore, it is
necessary to improve the estimation method for causal structures in such
conditions.

In this study, we propose a method to find causal structures for
continuous and discrete variables. To overcome the problems of the
existing method, we use the Link function. Using simulation studies, we
show that the proposed method performs more efficiently for data that
includes continuous and discrete variables.
