<span>**Abstract:**</span> We discuss a method of meta-analysis based on
symbolic data analysis (SDA). Meta-analysis, mainly used in social and
medical science, is a statistical method of combining scientific studies
to obtain quantitative results and provides a high level of evidence.
Differences between the studies are caused by heterogeneity between the
studies. It is useful to detect relationship among scientific studies. A
target of analysis on SDA is <span>*concept*</span>, a set of
individuals. We apply SDA to meta-analysis. In other words, we regard
scientific studies as concepts. For example, symbolic clustering or
symbolic MDS are useful to preprocess the scientific studies in
meta-analysis. In this study, we propose a new approach based on SDA for
meta-analysis and show the results of the proposed approach using
clinical datasets.
