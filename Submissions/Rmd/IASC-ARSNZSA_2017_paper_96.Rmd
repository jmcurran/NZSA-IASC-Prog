<span>**Abstract:**</span> Modeling and forecasting covariance matrices
of asset returns play a crucial role in finance. The availability of
high frequency intraday data enables the modeling of the realized
covariance matrix directly. However, most models in the literature
depend on strong structural assumptions and they also suffer from the
curse of dimensionality. To solve the problem, we propose a deep
learning model which treats each realized covariance matrix as an image.
The network structure is designed with simplicity in mind, and yet
provides superior accuracy compared with several advanced statistical
methods. The model could handle both low-dimensional and
high-dimensional realized covariance matrices.
