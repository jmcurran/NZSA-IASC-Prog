<span>**Abstract:**</span> In spatial data, detecting regions with
higher relative risk is of primary interest. A latent Markov random
field model with Gaussian mixture component is introduced, in which the
probit or the logit of the mixture weight for each location follows a
Gaussian Markov random field such as an intrinsic auto-regressive model
(Besag *et al.*, 1991). A mixture model with spatially correlated
weights was proposed by Fernández and Green (2002), and our modeling
with Gaussian mixture Markov random field can be extended to the cases
of involving covariate and random effects. Parameters are estimated by a
Bayesian approach, and the posterior mean of the mixture weight for each
location, which varies smoothly, gives meaningful interpretation for
spatial structure. Our computation was conducted with R Stan package, in
which the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method is implemented. Some
applications to disease mapping data are illustrated.
