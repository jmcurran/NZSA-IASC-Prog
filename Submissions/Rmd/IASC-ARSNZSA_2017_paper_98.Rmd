R has been used in the field of official statistics in Japan for over
ten years. This presentation takes up the case of the 2016 Economic
Census for Business Activity. The Census aims to identify the structure
of establishments and enterprises in all industries on a national and
regional level, and to obtain basic information to conduct various
statistical surveys by investigating the economic activity of these
establishments and enterprises. The major corporate accounting items,
such as sales, expenses and salaries, surveyed by the census require
imputation to avoid bias. Although ratio imputation is a leading
candidate, it is well known that the ratio estimator is very sensitive
to outliers; therefore, we need to take appropriate measures for this
problem.

Ratio imputation is a special case of regression imputation; however,
the conventional ratio estimator has a heteroscedastic error term, which
is the obstacle of robustification by means of M-estimation. New robust
ratio estimators are developed by segregating the homoscedastic error
term with no relation to the auxiliary variable from the original error.
The computation of the estimators are made by modifying iterative
reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm, since it is easy to calculate
and fast to converge. The proposed robustified ratio estimator broadens
the conventional definition of the ratio estimator with regards to the
variance of the error term in addition to effectively alleviating the
influence of outliers. The application of the robust estimator is
expected to contribute to the accuracy of the Census results.

An random number simulation to confirm the characteristics of these
estimators, deciding imputation domains by CART (classification and
regression tree), model selection and preparing necessary rates by
domain for the census data processing are conducted within the R
programming environment.
