<span>**Abstract:**</span> Most existing methods for GWAS data analysis
require individual-level genotype data as their input. However, it is
often not easy to get access to individual-level data, due to many
practical issues, such as privacy protection and disagreement on
data-sharing among multiple research groups. In this talk, we introduce
SSREM, a Summary-Statistics-based approach to estimating heritability,
co-heritability and effect sizes in GWAS data analysis. This is achieved
by Bayesian analysis with the standard random-effect prior and a
summary-statistics-based likelihood function. We have implemented a
parallel Gibbs sampling strategy, which allows us to handle
genome-wide-scale datasets. Our analysis results suggest that
summary-statistics-based analysis can achieve comparable performance to
individual-level data analysis.
